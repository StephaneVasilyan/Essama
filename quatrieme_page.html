            <h1> What Space Travel Will Look Like in the Future </h1>
            <h2>  Science fiction might inspire us to dream, but here’s a rather more realistic vision of what space travel will look like in the future. </h2>
            <p> When Jules Verne wrote his novel From the Earth to the Moon over 150 years ago, he imagined future space travel very differently to how it came to be when man first set foot on the Moon a century later in 1969. Instead of the technically impossible ‘space cannon’ described in the book, mankind’s first mission to the Moon blasted off from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center in an expendable, liquid-fuelled Saturn V rocket at nearly 25,000 miles per hour (40,000 kph). Fast-forward to the end of 2017, and we’re still relying on the same underlying technology to travel to the final frontier. That all space launches are carried out by rockets is far from the only limitation of current spaceflight. A far cry from the realm of science fiction space operas, there’s a lot that hasn’t changed at all in the last 56 years of manned space travel. Far from being a glamorous affair, real-life space travel still sees astronauts contending with the serious health challenges of excessive solar radiation and weightlessness. Even the relatively cutting-edge International Space Station can hardly be described as a comfortable place to live with its pokey quarters and general lack of comforts. So, what will space travel look like in another century from now, or even another ten years for that matter? While we’re still a long way off from the lofty dreams of science fiction, let’s explore how we might overcome some of the major challenges of human spaceflight in the future. </p>

            <h2> What Goes Up Must Float Around </h2>
            <h3> It might look like fun, but weightlessness takes a severe toll on the human body. </h3>
            <p>  From muscle loss to reduced effectiveness of the immune system, weightlessness is highly detrimental to human health, particularly over long periods. The realities of zero gravity have also proven highly inconvenient to science fiction authors to the extent that everyone miraculously walks around abroad their starships and on the surfaces of alien planets as they would on Earth. Unfortunately, there’s no known way to overcome the latter, which means future colonists on Mars, for example, will simply have to learn to get used to weighing only 38% of what they weigh on Earth. There’s little chance of long-distance space travel, let alone fully-fledged colonization of outer space taking off if we can’t find a way to generate a similar effect to Earth’s gravity. Fortunately, the scientific theory necessary to make artificial gravity is well-established, although current technical limitations make it very difficult to implement. Centripetal force can, in many ways, mimic the effects of gravity through rotation, but the technical requirements make its application no easy feat. For a start, your space habitat would need to have an enormous rotating ring in which its living areas would be located. To simulate Earth’s gravity, a ring with a 3,220-foot (1,000 metres) radius would need to make a full rotation once every 62.8 seconds, which requires a speed of 100 miles per hour (360 kph). The centre of the spaceship, or the rotational axis, would always remain in zero-g. With this model, people in the ring would be able to move around much like they would on Earth, although the ‘gravity’ felt at their heads would be lower than what they’d feel at their feet, thus leading to new problems such as disorientation, nausea and dizziness. These effects can be mitigated by having a larger ring, which would mean the gravity would be distributed over a larger area. The technology exists, and the theory is sound. Today, the fact that rotating space habitats don’t exist is largely down to a lack of necessity. Since short-term stays in space don’t have any serious effects on human health and comfort is not a priority, today’s space travellers simply have to do without the luxury of artificial gravity. Currently, the world’s space agencies, as well as some privately-owned companies, are turning their sights to Mars. To that end, one of the major areas of study for the ISS crew is the effects of zero-gravity over long-term exposure. If it’s deemed likely that humans can handle the one- or two-year trip to Mars and back without suffering severe health repercussions due to zero gravity, then it’s unlikely we’ll see artificial gravity become a thing in the foreseeable future. Once we finally start setting our sights to the outer planets and to the permanent colonization of space, it will be a very different story. To that end, there will no doubt come a time when artificial gravity becomes the norm in long-distance space travel and colonization by way of vast rotating habitats. The question is more a matter of when than if but, if manned space travel to Mars is going to become a thing by the 2030s, then it seems reasonable to expect artificial gravity to overcome one of the greatest challenges of space travel in the decades that follow. </p>

            <h2> Six Months to Mars, Eighty-Thousand Years to Alpha Centauri </h2>
            <h3> Future starships would have to rely on a far more efficient propulsion system than today’s liquid-fuel rockets. </h3>
            <p> The realms of science fiction often disregard the laws of physics, dismissing them as inconvenient facts getting in the way of a good story. Unfortunately, it’s the very fact that nothing can travel faster than light that makes future space travel à la Star Trek highly unlikely. That’s not to completely rule out the possibility of ever finding a way around the Universe’s speed limit; it’s just that concepts such as the Alcubierre warp drive step beyond the limits of accrued physics and are, therefore, not even known to be possible. With that in mind, let’s look at how we might overcome the problem of unimaginably large distances in the foreseeable future. While the Enterprise might be able to zip around the galaxy almost instantaneously, the reality of exploring solar systems of our own will be the product of monumental efforts spread across multip le generations. Current theory suggests it may one day be feasible to build spaceships capable of travelling up to 12% the speed of light, in which case it would take around 34 years to reach Alpha Centauri, the nearest star beyond the solar system. This would be achieved using nuclear fusion propulsion, which is itself beyond our current technological capabilities. NASA and DARPA are currently looking into the possibility of interstellar travel as part of their 100 Year Starship grant, an initiative that ultimately intends to make human interstellar travel possible within the next century. Far more likely than warp drives, however, the first manned interstellar spaceships will almost certainly be one-way trips owing to the distances and travel times involved. Trips beyond around ten light years, a relatively tiny distance in astronomical terms, would require generation ships, since it would take longer than a human lifetime to even reach the destination. Assuming interstellar travel will take the form of slower-than-light travel, which is currently the only way we know to be possible, the challenges involved in such a trip would be truly immense. For a start, artificial gravity would be a must but, even more importantly, any interstellar spacecraft would have to be fully self-sustaining. In other words, it would need to be an entirely independent ecosystem capable of generating and supporting its own atmosphere, water and food crops. To that end, even with the challenge of distance met, there would still be a whole lot more to think about. Another option, and one that any sci-fi aficionado will be familiar with, is suspended animation. Induced hibernation would help overcome many of the challenges of long-distance spaceflight, such as the consumption of resources and the fact that a lot of trips would take longer than a human lifetime. However, suspended animation might even become a thing long before we start aiming for the stars. In fact, even NASA is exploring the possibility of human stasis during the long trip to Mars. Perhaps, future space travel won’t look like much at all, since we’ll be fast asleep for the journey! </p>
            
            <h2> How to Build a World </h2>
            <h3> Future space habitats would be enormous, the result of monumental efforts to make the permanent habitation of space truly viable. </h3>
            <p> If living in space is ever to become anything more than a scientific curiosity, then it will become necessary to literally build a new world; a fully self-sustaining habitat that doesn’t need any help or intervention from us here on Earth. In fact, it seems possible, perhaps even inevitable, that we will one day need to colonize space to save our species from our own destructive tendencies. This line of thinking does, of course, set a very dangerous precedence but, even if it does (hopefully) turn out that we can look after our own planet, the lust for exploration is an innate human trait. With enough motivation, whether by necessity or inspiration upon finding definitive evidence of life among the stars, it will likely one day be technical feasible to build a self-sustaining space habitat. Initially, space habitats would import their resources from Earth but, when it comes to interstellar journeys, recycling would be necessary for maintaining a consistent water, air and food supply. However, even recycling has its limits, since a percentage of the original product will always be lost in the process. In other words, recycling is and can never be 100% efficient. The limits of recycling would require any self-sustaining space habitat to be able to mine resources from things like asteroids, comets and even the surrounding space. Fortunately, the ingredients needed to sustain life, such as water and nitrogen, are widely available throughout the solar system and no doubt beyond, although space missions would still need to be able to stock up for those immensely long journeys spanning the practically empty stretches of interstellar space. If indeed the more distant future, say a hundred plus years from now, self-sustaining space habitats become a thing, they’ll no doubt be vast. Presenting a monolithic scientific and technological endeavour, these habitats will likely come in the form of toroidal or cylindrical colonies built to emulate Earth’s gravity and sustain complex ecosystems that can operate on their own for indefinite periods. </p>

            <h3> Future space colonies could house tens of thousands of people, complete with artificially generated gravity providing many of the comforts of home. </h3>

        <h1> 10 Predictions about the Future of Small Satellites and New Space </h1>
        <p> Innovation forms an integral part of the DNA of the space industry. In the New Space age, every year new advances and discoveries arise that open up opportunities of all kinds for governments and companies of different sizes and sectors. If we want to anticipate what the future of small satellites will look like in the short and medium term, there are some trends that can already be glimpsed and that can serve as a reference. It goes without saying that it is not easy to predict the future of an industry with a high level of innovation. From what we know about the past and present of the sector, we begin with our main predictions about the future of small satellites. </p>

        <h2> 1. An increase in the number of small satellite launches </h2>
        <p> Thanks to New Space, the traditional barriers preventing access to space have disappeared. In 2018, 253 satellites weighing between 1 and 50 kg were launched worldwide, according to the most recent study by SpaceWorks, although this figure will increase considerably in the next few years. More and more startups, companies and governments have the capacity to have their own satellites. In fact, SpaceWorks expects between 513 and 745 launches in 2023. If those forecasts are met, the number of small satellites launched into space would at least double within five years. And in the most optimistic scenario, it would almost triple. </p>

        <h2> 2. A more prominent role for larger sized CubeSats (6U & 12U) </h2>
        <p> Some of the advances we will see concerning the future of small satellites (greater data processing and transmission capacity, artificial intelligence, propulsion systems, etc.) are closely related to the growing trend towards the use of larger CubeSats. The 6U and 12U platforms are gaining prominence in the sector in order to respond to these new needs. </p>

        <h2> 3. Larger constellations and improved coordination between CubeSats </h2>
        <p> The space industry is moving towards a future with large constellations of small satellites capable of providing all types of services in large geographical areas or across the globe. This trend in turn implies new challenges for satellite coordination and management. Some solutions such as ISL (Inter-Satellite Link) communication technology will help optimise coordination between CubeSats in the same constellation so that satellites are able to communicate with each other for different purposes. For example, CubeSats will be able to transfer data in space without intermediaries, so that the satellite that has direct vision with the ground station will be responsible for gathering and downloading all this information through a high-speed link. These advances will also allow very precise formation flights, which will help with the coordination of CubeSats to work together on applications such as SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), which require a high level of resolution, and which would otherwise only be possible with large satellites. This commitment to better coordination of CubeSats has also led to the proposal of satellite docking projects, another innovation that will be arriving in the next few years. Among the possibilities offered by this solution would be the ability to provide on-orbit services (e.g. for refuelling) or even to 'piece-build' a larger satellite in space, so that different CubeSats can function as building blocks of a larger structure. The use of sensors and thrusters would make it possible to achieve the level of precision required to couple two (or more) small satellites in orbit. </p>

        <h2> 4. The transformation on its way thanks to artificial intelligence </h2>
        <p> Artificial intelligence (AI) is also arriving in space. If we focus on the future of small satellites, this transformation will bring important advances. First of all, let's think about automatic diagnostics based on telemetry, thanks to artificial intelligence tools that will make it possible to anticipate future problems based on current telemetry data from satellites. Another interesting aspect is the application of AI for on-board information processing and the reduction of download data. In Earth observation or Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) applications, for example, this pre-processing of information would make it possible to carry out the analysis in space and download only the specific data or images necessary for the mission. Another of the future applications of artificial intelligence has to do with automatic learning systems for the management of satellite constellations. Intelligent ground station networks and automatic learning systems will optimise the control of large CubeSats constellations. Artificial intelligence will help to simplify the management of all tasks associated with the control of satellites and the services they provide. </p>

        <h2> 5. Greater data processing and transmission capacity </h2>
        <p> Some of the most typical uses of CubeSats call for high data processing and transmission capacities. This is one of the most important technical challenges facing small satellites in the New Space age. Some CubeSats have already started to include Ku-Band and Ka-Band transmitters, with rates of several hundred megabits (Mb) per second, or even gigabits (Gb). These solutions require higher power consumption to improve data transmission capacity, which in turn implies the need for larger satellites. It is also possible to achieve very high data transmission rates using laser communication systems, another of the avenues that the sector may follow in the coming years. This solution requires high levels of precision so that the satellite's laser beam is perfectly aligned with the receiver located on Earth, while in LEO orbits at a speed of around 7.8 kilometres per second. </p>

        <h2> 6. Increased use of propulsion systems for CubeSats </h2>
        <p> Many CubeSats projects do not require propulsion systems for satellites to complete the task for which they were designed, although this is a solution that can be useful in certain types of missions. The future of small satellites in the coming years points towards an increase in the use of electric, chemical or water propellants that allow CubeSats to move in a controlled and deliberate way without resorting to passive methods. For example, these propulsion systems make it possible to modify or adjust the orbits of small satellites. </p>

        <h2> 7. Improvements in active and passive de-orbiting systems </h2>
        <p> The presence of space junk in Earth's orbit is one of the main concerns of the sector, as this debris poses a risk to functioning satellites. Today's CubeSats are designed to enter the Earth's atmosphere at the end of their useful life, so that they disintegrate without leaving a trace, although in some cases this process can last for years, and if something goes wrong, they may end up as space junk. The de-orbiting systems are in charge of guiding this process of leaving orbit and controlled destruction. The trend in the sector is towards an improvement in these procedures, which in part are closely related to the propulsion systems we have just seen. These active de-orbiting systems include electric, chemical and water propellants, which allow the CubeSat to be guided towards the Earth's atmosphere once it has completed its mission. Work is also underway on improving the efficiency of passive de-orbiting systems, such as braking using Air Drag Augmentation Devices (DADs) and systems such as magnetic torques or inertia wheels. In both cases, these are fundamental advances towards the objective of achieving in the coming years a reduction in the level of risk associated with the increase in space junk in the Earth's orbit. </p>

        <h2> 8. Origami and new high-tech solutions for antennas </h2>
        <p> The limited size of CubeSats makes it necessary to seek imaginative solutions for the technology that travels on board satellites, so that it takes up as little space as possible. One of the areas in which most progress has been made and in which interesting innovations are expected in the coming years is connected with antennas. For example, there are already missions such as NASA’s RainCube project, which apply the Japanese art of origami in this field. The parabolic antennas are folded to occupy as little space as possible, and are only unfurled once in orbit. These folding solutions make it possible to have bigger and better antennas in space, with everything this implies for improving communications and for the future of small satellites. </p>

        <h2> 9. Increased use of CubeSats for space exploration </h2>
        <p> The small satellites MarCO A & B reached an important milestone just one year ago, when they became the first two CubeSats to travel into deep space, as a part of NASA’s InSight mission to Mars. Beyond their multiple applications in Earth orbit, there is now also talk of CubeSats as the future of space exploration. New opportunities have also arisen in this field related to scientific projects outside of Earth orbit. The European Space Agency (ESA), for example, has two CubeSats 6U as a part of its Hera mission to travel to the dual asteroid Didymos, with the aim of obtaining information about how to re-route asteroids that pose a potential threat to the Earth. In the field of science, some projects have also begun to evaluate the possibility of using CubeSats for the calibration of latest generation telescopes, in order to obtain clearer images of all types of celestial objects. It should also be remembered that small satellites are ideal for testing new technologies in space (In-Orbit Demonstration). In fact, one of the advantages of CubeSats is the ability to take greater risks, because in terms of development times and costs, it is not the same to lose a small satellite as a large one.  </p>

        <h2> 10. Appearance of new regulations  </h2>
        <p> The increased number of CubeSat launches and the number of small satellite constellations will entail the appearance of new regulations, which will allow all new projects to be safely accommodated and avoid interference. These regulations could relate, for example, to frequencies, orbits, quality standards, cyber security or de-orbiting systems. New Space continues to be an inexhaustible source of new business opportunities. New and promising technical advances are appearing in the future of small satellites that will help boost the practical applications of CubeSats. Some of these findings will be closely related to these 10 predictions, but some surprises also await us. Time will tell how accurate these predictions are. </p>

        <h1> Future of Space Travel </h1>
        <p> Over 50 years ago, Neil Armstrong took one small step for man and a giant leap for mankind. Most of humanity’s knowledge about foreign worlds comes from robotic exploration through various orbiters, rovers, and landers. They have been extensively used to study numerous celestial bodies including the Sun, Moon, Mercury and, Venus. Voyager 1 even went past the orb cloud into the far reaches of the cosmos. It took 40 years to just go 19 light-hours away from earth and would still take a millennium to reach the next star system. With tons of milestones being achieved in the space industry that, humans themselves are too thrilled to make any interstellar journey possible in the next 50-60 years. 

            Various major breakthroughs will exponentially transform the space technology and in no time, mankind will be seen acquiring planets. Billionaires buying personal small moons as vacation homes will just be something normal. People having small jets parked in their backyard to meet their relative who lives on the neighbouring planet.
            
            These things must sound like a dream but it’s happening fast. </p>

        <h2> 1. Breakthrough Starshot Initiatives </h2>
        <p> It was Launched 2015 to develop a fleet of light sails spacecraft named StarChip which will be capable of reaching at least 20% the speed of light. Cofounded by none other than Mark Zuckerberg and backed by noble physicist, one of them being Stephen Hawking aims to reach alpha Centauri star system 4.37 light-years away. </p>

        <h2> 2. James Webb Space Telescope </h2>
        <p> Planned to be the next version of Hubble Space Telescope with much-improved resolution and sensitivity. The primary mirror, the Optical Telescope element, comprises of 18 hexagonal mirror segments made of gold-plated beryllium which combine to create a 6.5-metre diameter mirror much larger than the Hubble’s 2.4-metre mirror. The feature to observe in a lower frequency range, from long-wavelength visible light allows high redshift object. </p>

        <h2> 3. Artemis Program </h2>
        <p> Current ongoing crewed spaceflight program by NASA partnered with ESA with the sole goal of landing “the first woman and the next man” on the moon’s lunar south pole region by 2024. This would bring about establishing a sustainable presence on the moon. NASA this year requested an additional 1.6 billion dollars fund for the mission for the fiscal year 2020. </p>

        <h2> 4. Orbital spacecraft </h2>
        <p> Boeing is developing Starline Spacecraft in the hope to begin carrying astronauts to the ISS in 2021.Companies such as Blue Origin and Virgin galactic specializing in what is called as Sub-Orbital space tourism aiming to give zero-gravity somersaults to passengers able to pay a big amount for it. </p>

        <h2> 5. This could be a very interesting one, New electric propulsion chamber. </h2>
        <p> Yes, you heard it, Think of it as EV Rocket. Sounds reasonable. At the Aerospace Corporation’s El Secundo Campus, electric propulsion is the new thrust technology for future rockets is being tested. Unlike fire and smoke, this harnesses electric energy to ionize gas into plasma, which is accelerated out of the thruster through electromagnetic forces. The fuel is still weak to launch through the atmosphere but once it reaches into space the true potential is put out. </p>

        <h2> 6. Parker Solar Probe mission </h2>
        <p> A scientific mission to unlock the secret of sun’s corona and solar wind. The first-ever mission to touch the sun. </p>

        <h2> 7. Europan Jupiter System Mission-Laplace </h2>
        <p> A joint mission by NASA/ESA to explore the various Jupiter’s moons with a primary focus on EUROPAN and Ganymede. </p>

        <h2> 8. Titan Saturn System Mission </h2>
        <p> Again, a joint mission by NASA-ESA, with an aim for an exploration of Saturn and its moons Titan and Enceladus. </p>

        <p> Both robotic and manned exploration of deep space will reach advance potentials in the coming decade to reach life-harbouring moons and even interstellar worlds. By 2050 it is possible to have a leap beyond the horizons of just earth or mars. </p>

        <h1> What is the future of the International Space Station? </h1>
        <p> Time is not a friend for the International Space Station. American efforts to extend its closing until 2030 possibly beyond are dependent upon evaluations of its continued safety and integrity. Materials in space age under the stresses of the space environment and deteriorate over time. Yet, evaluating the possible future for the ISS will not be strictly based upon technical factors. The states participating in the ISS all pursue various agendas. For most, being on the ISS is only part of their space portfolio, albeit a large one in many cases. So, ending the ISS and deorbiting the structure is a dramatic shift in direction for them, especially if terminated earlier than projected. What would replace that endeavor remains unclear. </p>
        
        <h3> Why now? </h3>
        <p> Let us be clear, the evaluation of the ISS will be a technical exercise but politics in the end will determine the ultimate outcome. For the United States, the ISS has faded in importance with the Artemis Program first up. The station’s importance declined earlier during the Constellation Program even before construction was completed. At that time, the ISS would have been terminated by 2016. Let us be clear, the evaluation of the ISS will be a technical exercise but politics in the end will determine the ultimate outcome. Arrival on the lunar surface in 2024 by the US is improbable given the delays over lunar program funding, both in terms of congressional funding support or lack thereof and the decision to select only a single contractor for the human lunar lander (SpaceX). That latter decision is being challenged by Blue Origin with unknown delays created by the legal process. More telling is the delay imposed by failure to develop a suitable spacesuit for the mission to the lunar surface. This is a single-point failure for the program. There is no interest in a one-way mission back to the lunar surface. That may occur effectively in a future Mars mission unless the environmental hazards of inflight radiation and microgravity are neutralized. The more that is learned about the space environment, the more hazardous we find radiation effects are on the human body. As one solution, NASA is now moving toward fostering private space station options, the Commercial LEO Destinations (CLD) project. What this means is under development presently, although the possibilities for startup concepts is still fluid. The clearest direction is in the statement: “With commercial destinations, we believe it will create a self-sustaining and self-reinforcing low-Earth orbit economy—one where the private sector is the main player, and NASA is one of many customers.” Unfortunately, the previously most visible company pursuing habitats in space, Bigelow Aerospace, has ended operations. Its module on the ISS, the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM), was the first effort at a private station module. Operations ceased due, according to Bigelow, NASA’s failure to pay what is owed. In a sense, the successful experience of the NASA cargo and crew private flight options encourages NASA to duplicate that success in a private space station endeavor. The agency’s share of the cost would, in principle, be significantly reduced given the potential for economic return from a future space station. The ISS is slowly becoming in one sense a partial proof of concept: one can potentially make money from in-space activities besides the electronic movement of data through comsats or remote sensing or satellite navigation applications. This represents another manifestation of NewSpace success altering the policy context within which NASA decisions are made. NASA will participate through contracts to use whatever space station is constructed. Through early engagement, NASA will influence what how the new space station is configured but will not dictate the specifics. Private sector funding will become more central to the project than those two flight programs servicing the ISS. In these earlier and ongoing programs, NASA was more motivated to pay because it needed to access the ISS for both practical and symbolic reasons. The United States could not allow the ISS to fail while US prestige hinged on being able to independently access the ISS, not at the whim of the Russians. Russian space agency leaders had a habit of ridiculing the American loss of flight capability to the ISS. The questions arising about the ISS and its capacity for continued operations are moving possibly faster than originally thought. In a more cynical note, one can observe a stream of reports and accusations from especially Russian sources since at least 2018 that the ISS is failing. Air leaks were discovered several times in the Zarya module: small ones but concerning. Russian officials also accused US astronauts of creating holes in a Soyuz capsule, reports denied by the United States. More recent reports have circulated that cracks have appeared in the ISS structure, the Zarya module, suggesting metal fatigue has advanced sufficiently to render the ISS unsafe. The latter accusation reappeared in the aftermath of an accident when the Russian Nauka module docked with the ISS. An apparent software glitch caused the module to fire its engines after docking, knocking the ISS out of its normal orientation. This dramatically endangered the space station, but control was reacquired and the station brought back under control and into the correct orientation. After that, more reports of cracks in the ISS began to appear suggesting the ISS was unsafe. Shutting down the ISS prior to 2030 (the US suggested end date) would free Russia to pursue other pathways. One obvious option would be joining China in its expanding space station program. The two states have already begun planning a station on the lunar surface. This alliance would be consistent with broader Russian actions although Russia would be clearly the second to China. Russia’s space program is in a period of transition. The termination of the Soyuz missions carrying US astronauts to the ISS removes the fiscal incentive for Russian participation in the ISS. Russia has spoken of a Russian space station but financially that might be a reach given other national priorities. Clearly, Russia currently is unlikely to make the investment necessary for such a project. Russia’s biggest advantage until recently was its skilled human capital and inventories of technologies left over from the Soviets. The human capital has aged out of the system while the inventories have run down. More recent technology development has taken longer than usual given Russian capabilities. Russia to the side, other partners in the ISS may become uneasy about future directions. China has offered the opportunities for participation, but the actual contours of possible activity are being worked out. The Europeans are the most likely important group considering large scale engagement in the Chinese space station while Japan remains closer to the United States for now. </p>

        <h3> The murky future </h3>
        <p> The questions arising about the ISS and its capacity for continued operations are moving possibly faster than originally thought. One must remember the ISS took a long time for its construction to be essentially completed. Earlier NASA difficulties in program management led to a program much different and later than originally conceived. Cost overruns were persistent undermining congressional confidence in the agency. Ironically, the Columbia shuttle accident forced NASA to set a completion date and then push to accomplish that goal albeit a year late. Since ISS completion, additional components have been added but much of the activity has been maintenance and upgrading existing capabilities. The station has now broadened its mix of research and development tasks to include more commercial applications (at a small scale but a start.) The point is that the ISS may finally be pushing into realms of activity beyond simply supporting NASA’s human space exploration efforts. At one point under the Constellation program, all research on the ISS was directed to support human space exploration. ISS is finally demonstrating what was originally envisioned: a space station as a location for a wide spectrum of research and development activities. This broader spectrum of activities provides an example for a multitask-oriented successor space station rather than a simply a space hotel for wealthy tourists. Those activities could be supported but as part of a viable economic activity. The groundwork for such a general-purpose facility in Earth orbit would become the foundation for an international venue. As such it could complement the Chinese Space Station (CSS), broadening human activity in space. Through either location, space can be opened to the global community. The private sector would provide access, open to those with their payloads capable of paying the necessary costs and who have reserved space on the station. ISS is finally demonstrating what was originally envisioned: a space station as a location for a wide spectrum of research and development activities. The future of the ISS is clearly finite but when exactly it ends is unclear. The Russian/Soviet Mir space station provides an example of how long a structure in space can survive and be productive, albeit on a declining curve. Mir was poorly maintained due to Russian economic issues, but its demise occurred because Russia could not participate in the ISS and still sustain the Mir. Mir left orbit in 2001, still useful but no long viable given limited resources. The ISS is the Mir of this generation, possibly becoming obsolete but still functional for most purposes. The CSS also has a finite lifespan, but no one currently knows what that means. China will have to decide when that time comes and what is to replace it. For human space exploration and exploitation of outer space to be truly globally productive requires maximum effort. Space stations are few and far between, so discarding one prematurely is unlikely to advance the general enterprise. China and the United States are presently competing with each other but the infrastructure both are building, separately or in association with others, must be employed for the pursuit of peaceful exploration and exploitation of outer space. Such an approach opens outer space throughout the global community by the providing the first step to everywhere in outer space. To this point, space had been conceptualized in terms of missions rather than functions. Therefore, the US goes the Moon or Mars in a series of distinct missions rather than making space access and habitation a routine and continuing process. Through the latter, others now earthbound will be able to join the great quest of space exploration and exploitation. One must remember that the latter of those two activities is the future of space. While all humans can benefit from activities in space, the few conducted today are too limiting in terms of engaging the human race in space. </p>

        <h1> The future of space tourism: op-ed </h1>
        <p> Dylan Taylor is a global entrepreneur, investor and philanthropist who acts as the Chairman and CEO of Voyager Space Holdings and the founder of Space for Humanity, a nonprofit organization that seeks to democratize space exploration. He has also served as an active advocate and philanthropist in the space manufacturing industry and a strategic advisor for the Archmission and the Human Spaceflight Program while also acting as the co-founding patron of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation. He contributed this article to Space.com's Expert Voices: Opinions and Insights. It's true that 2020 spawned a collective feeling of retreat coupled with a FOMO (fear of missing out) that inspires us to escape a chaotic world. For now, we have the silence of nature or an eventual trip abroad, but the future can provide a more adventurous escape: one to the stars. The NewSpace industry has its sights set on space tourism, a growing market expected to be worth at least $3 billion by 2030. As companies like SpaceX test reusable rocket technology to make spaceflight more affordable and accessible for humans, other private firms, including Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, are investing in suborbital space tourism to take Earthlings into the very edge of space and back. While only uber-wealthy passengers and private researchers will have access to space tourism in the immediate future, the long term holds promises for ordinary citizens. The evolution of technology plays a vital role in sending more tourists to space and a few influential trends will determine the future of space tourism, along with the progress we make both on and off our home planet. </p>
        
        <h2> Commercial suborbital trips </h2>

        <p> Suborbital travel will likely be the space tourism subsector to materialize first, but it may also be the most short-lived. However, Blue Origin, backed by Jeff Bezos, is testing its New Shepard system that will launch customers to the edge of space in a capsule which separates from a small rocket and retreats back to Earth under parachutes. Richard Branson's company Virgin Galactic relies on a space plane, dropped from a carrier aircraft, with a rocket motor that speeds up and takes passengers high into the atmosphere. Both companies' shuttle systems are designed to fly passengers over 50 miles above Earth's atmosphere, allowing customers to experience the feeling of weightlessness for a few minutes. Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo will launch its next human spaceflight test on Dec. 11 as Blue Origin eyes early 2021. These brief spaceflights hold opportunities for tourism and scientific research and present unique experiences for space observation at varying trajectories and regulatory requirements. However, Axios reports concerns over declined public interest in suborbital tourism as a passing interest due to high costs and a short-lived ride. This may deflate the market as passengers await new developments in the field. But there's some hope. Some experts look to commercial suborbital trips to take the place of long-distance air travel that can eventually cater to everyday citizens. SpaceX plans to use its Starship rocket to fly 100 people around the world in mere minutes. The company stated that a 15-hour flight to Shanghai from New York would be capable of flying in 39 minutes. According to UBS, if even only 5% of the average 150 million passengers that travel on 10 hour or longer flights pay $2,500 per trip, then returns could skyrocket to $20 billion per year in today's value. A recent UBS report mentions, "Space tourism could be the stepping stone for the development of long-haul travel on earth serviced by space." </p>

        <h2> Orbital vacations </h2>
        <p> Orbital tourism, which entails remaining in space for at least one full orbit, is another major focus of governmental agencies and private space companies, all of which have the long-term goal to inhabit the moon and Mars. Projects from Boeing, SpaceX and Axiom Space plan to start launching tourists to the International Space Station on commercial spacecraft beginning as early as this year. SpaceX is also partnering with Space Adventures to send four tourists to low Earth orbit for a few days in late 2021 or early 2022. As more companies consider in-space tourism, orbital vacations are set to become a popular trend. Orbital vacationing infrastructure, including orbital and lunar-based hotels, is positioned to become lucrative as space infrastructure companies already hauled in a combined $3.6 billion so far this year. Much of this infrastructure remains in preliminary stages, but the first approach may be to establish low-orbit hotels. One hotel design expects to send guests in a hydrogen-filled balloon with a pressurized capsule, utilizing Earth's gravity. Other options include designing or renovating an existing space station to accommodate guests. NASA, for instance, is opening up the International Space Station for commercial tourism. The Aurora Station, a planned luxury hotel that will host six guests for a $9.5 million, 12-day stay in low Earth orbit, will charge $9.5 million for the trip. It's pricey, but experts predict prices will fall like they did in the tech industry for computers and mobile phones. Advertisement A proposal for expandable space habitats may also serve as orbital hotels. Made of unique materials and easily stored at home, they are launched to space where they're inflated to true size. Bigelow Space invented the B330, a space habitat that enlarges to form a hotel or living area for humans in space. As demand increases, they are interconnected to other inflatable habitats to increase their size. Bigelow also plans to develop an attached inflated module to the International Space Station as one of the first hotels in space. In-space vacations will eventually be the gateway for moon and Mars habitation. </p>

        <h2> Nurturing the space and world economies </h2>
        <p> Private space companies are devotedly investing across space tourism and firms like UBS consider access to space an enabler to broader opportunities for investment. More next-generation engineers will enter the space tourism sector for the scope of opportunities and innovation, eventually decreasing the barriers to entry that will increase competition, lower costs, and ultimately democratize space travel for everyday citizens. Of course, there are crucial safety, comfort and health factors to consider. Training, medical screenings and liability waivers will need to be examined before tourists head to space. Space tourism will be a small subsector of the industry, but it will bolster the entire NewSpace industry. Once space tourism does become mainstream, it will also positively impact many socioeconomic factors on Earth: creating jobs, educating citizens about space and fostering a new solar-based energy infrastructure. The sweet escape to the stars can eventually awaken us to the awe-inspiring potential of space exploration while also giving us a better appreciation of home. </p>
