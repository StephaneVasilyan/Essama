<h2>
    What will the world look like in the future?
</h2>
<h4>
    According to the report's predictions, we will therefore have to build ever higher to house the inhabitants. We will no longer face simple skyscrapers, we will live in gigantic mega-structures, grouping together several towers. But the underground world will also begin to be colonized with residential structures that will sink up to 25 stories underground.

Since the Earth is more than 70% covered by oceans, the latter will not be left out, according to the report. The latter imagines "aquatic cities" in which the houses would form sorts of bubbles, immersed under water. At the same time, systems would be created to transform the water into a breathable atmosphere while the movement of the waves would provide energy.

<h2>
    Living on another planet?
</h2>
<h4>
    The ideal is not to go too far, on a planet resembling the Earth, with an atmosphere to protect us from radiation and meteorites, a relatively regulated temperature, endowed with ice or liquid water, with days and nights, and if possible rocky.

Mars is our closest neighbour, it takes about a year and a half to get there, but it doesn't meet all of these criteria. Proxima b would be a more directly habitable option… But this planet is located outside the solar system and it would take at least 100,000 years to reach it!

<h2>
    These wars that await us
</h2>
<h4>
    The wars of the future will be urban, fragmented, undoubtedly chemical or biological, causing massive displacements of refugees. The boundaries between the military and the civilian, the conventional and the unconventional, the international and the national, the legitimate and the criminal, are abolished. War, unquestionably, has a future. Not happy.

    Want a dog? Take a robot!
<h2>
    <h4>
        A robot dog like the one Sony thought up in 2006, AIBO, doesn't ask for food, doesn't need to be out in summer or winter, doesn't get sick. In short, no costs apart from the purchase. Admittedly, he does not have the "giant comforter" side full of hair that is so comforting but it would not take much to create this version. Some sites have even taken an interest in robotic animal rights!

    Save the Planet: Vertical Farms
</h2>
 <h4>
    The world is currently concerned by a major challenge. Today, we are 7 billion on Earth and the figure will be estimated at 9 billion in 2050. An inevitable question arises: what solutions exist to feed all humanity? As we have just seen, razing forests to plant fields there would be a disaster for biodiversity. This is why the “vertical farms” project was devised. Recently, 7x7 gave you 7 good reasons to start urban agriculture. The "vertical farms" are these uninhabited buildings whose function is to house crops of all kinds, whether rice fields, orchards or even vegetable gardens or wheat fields. This project is part of the legitimate need to double food production. If the plants will grow here above ground, these vertical farms will have the advantage of the absence of the use of pesticides, the crops being protected from insects and bacteria. Finally, given that 80% of the world's population will live in cities in 2050, these vertical farms should make it possible to considerably reduce transport time between cities and the countryside. So many advantages, which countries like China, Japan, Singapore and the United States have noticed. It is in the latter country, in Chicago, that the first vertical farm in the world was set up in 2010. In Japan, nearly 300 projects are underway. In Singapore, a city-state with very little arable land, the company Sky Greens has set up 550 vertical farms, each 9 meters high. The future has already begun.
