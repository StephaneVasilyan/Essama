<h2>
    what will the world look like in the future?
</h2>
<h4>
    According to the report's predictions, we will therefore have to build ever higher to house the inhabitants. We will no longer face simple skyscrapers, we will live in gigantic mega-structures, grouping together several towers. But the underground world will also begin to be colonized with residential structures that will sink up to 25 stories underground.

Since the Earth is more than 70% covered by oceans, the latter will not be left out, according to the report. The latter imagines "aquatic cities" in which the houses would form sorts of bubbles, immersed under water. At the same time, systems would be created to transform the water into a breathable atmosphere while the movement of the waves would provide energy.

<h2>
    Living on another planet?
</h2>
<h4>
    The ideal is not to go too far, on a planet resembling the Earth, with an atmosphere to protect us from radiation and meteorites, a relatively regulated temperature, endowed with ice or liquid water, with days and nights, and if possible rocky.

Mars is our closest neighbour, it takes about a year and a half to get there, but it doesn't meet all of these criteria. Proxima b would be a more directly habitable option… But this planet is located outside the solar system and it would take at least 100,000 years to reach it!

<h2>
    These wars that await us
</h2>
<h4>
    The wars of the future will be urban, fragmented, undoubtedly chemical or biological, causing massive displacements of refugees. The boundaries between the military and the civilian, the conventional and the unconventional, the international and the national, the legitimate and the criminal, are abolished. War, unquestionably, has a future. Not happy.
