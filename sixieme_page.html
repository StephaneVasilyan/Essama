            <h1> The animals that may exist in a million years, imagined by biologists </h1>
            <p> Fully aquatic whale-rats. Praying mantises the size of dogs. Scientists imagine the future evolution of life on Earth. While it can sometimes seem like humanity is hell-bent on environmental destruction, it’s unlikely our actions will end all life on Earth. Some creatures are sure to endure in this age of mass extinction and climate crisis. Over time, they will adapt to a harsher world we’ve helped create, evolving to meet the moment as best they can. Some of these transformations have gotten underway in our lifetimes. Climate change, some research suggests, is already “shape shifting” animals — shrinking certain migratory birds and speeding up the life cycles of amphibians, for example. No one knows exactly what changes to plants and animals will transpire in the years to come. Still, evolutionary biologists say it’s worth trying to imagine what creatures will evolve in the future. “I do think it’s a really useful and important exercise,” Liz Alter, professor of evolutionary biology at California State University Monterey Bay, says on the latest episode of Unexplainable, Vox’s podcast about unanswered questions in science. In thinking about the animals of the future, Alter says, we must consider how we’re changing the environment now. “It’s a very sobering thing to think about the long future,” she says. I spoke to several evolutionary biologists and paleontologists who, along with Alter, helped me imagine what animals might exist one day — say, millions of years into the future — and how our actions could spur their arrival. At the very least, it’s reassuring to know that life almost certainly will find a way, with or without us. But it may never be the same. </p>

            <h3> Animals that might make it </h3>
            <p> What animals are likely to exist tens of thousands, or even millions of years from now? That’s the big question I posed to everyone I spoke with, and their responses fell along three main lines of thinking. Some started off by thinking about which animals alive today are most likely to endure human-caused climate change and mass extinction. (Scientists have identified five major extinction events in natural history, and many say we are living through or on the cusp of a sixth one now, caused largely by human activity.) Others began by imagining the potential environments of the future, and what adaptations might lead creatures to survive in them. A third group thought about the deep history of life on Earth, and what types of animals that used to roam the planet might return, in new forms, long after we are gone. First off, the survivors: “These are rats, rodents, and also things like cockroaches and pigeons,” said Jingmai O’Connor, a paleontologist at the Field Museum in Chicago. These animals “are doing just fine despite the worst that we’re doing to this planet.” If these species survive the ecological changes that are occurring now, they might also evolve to fill ecological space left behind by extinct animals. For instance, if tigers go extinct in the next million years, perhaps flightless, carnivorous pigeons and rats will grow to the size of ostriches and snack on the animals that tigers once ate. It’s impossible to predict which specific adaptations might emerge in which animals, but it’s clear that as some species die off, they leave a gap in the food chain that can be filled by other species. In the far, far future, rodents are especially well poised to thrive if mammal species continue to go extinct. By introducing rats everywhere we’ve settled, humans have increased the genetic diversity of rats, which makes them more adaptable to their surroundings. More genetic diversity means “potential solutions to different [environmental] challenges they might face,” says Alexis Mychajliw, a paleoecologist at Middlebury College. Already, scientists have noted rats evolving adaptations to thrive in specific cities, like New York. They might even be able to further adapt to living amid heavy metal pollution and radioactivity, or to be able to eat toxic waste, Mychajliw says. And if life on land grows too harsh, rats may be able to slowly adapt to water. Perhaps their evolutionary descendants will lose their fur or sprout flippers, developing streamlined bodies suited for a fully aquatic existence. Other marine mammals, like seals and whales, have followed this path in their transition from land-dwelling creatures to aquatic ones. Again, these specific evolutionary paths are pure speculation. But experts say they’re within the realm of possibility. </p>

            <h3> The environments of the future that will shape evolution </h3>
            <p> The second way to think about animals of the future is by imagining the environments of the future. Environments can drive evolution by exerting selection pressure, favoring some traits over others. For example, some birds have evolved long, pointy beaks to draw nectar out of flowers. If anything, there will likely be plastic in the environment well into the future. Of all the elements that humans have introduced into the environment, plastic waste is already ubiquitous, and remnants of it might linger for millennia if humans go on producing it as we have. Plastic is “a big source of carbon, which all living things depend on,” said Sahas Barve, an evolutionary ecologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Plastic, he added, could become food, and “any animal that can exploit that will be successful.” In a way, this development would kind of go full circle: Many plastics are made from petroleum, which is called a fossil fuel precisely because it derives from ancient, transmogrified plant and animal remains. So new life forms could learn to eat the leftovers of really, really old ones. Termites could be one such critter. These insects already have a gut microbiome — a collection of microorganisms that help with digestion — that breaks down cellulose. Like plastic, cellulose is made of a complex carbon polymer, so it’s not a stretch to imagine termites adapting to break down another polymer like plastic. “I could easily imagine them evolving a microbiome that helps them then digest plastic,” Barve says. Some fungi and bacteria, including some found in the stomachs of cows, are already able to break down plastic. The distant future is also likely to be more watery, as sea-level rise decreases the portion of the planet covered by dry land. In envisioning a world of rising seas and altered coastlines, some scientists think about how certain animals might take to living in more marine environments. Sharlene Santana, a professor of biology at the University of Washington, considers how a bat species might evolve to live off of, and around, the oceans. She imagines a bat with a six-foot wingspan taking shape, capable of gliding like an albatross instead of flapping its wings, perhaps covering hundreds of miles in search of food or islands to roost. It might use finely-tuned echolocation to sense ripples in the water in order to detect fish. (In fact, some bats already do this.) “This bat is doing something that bats cannot do today, which is to sail and soar on ocean air currents for very long distances,” Santana says. “I call it the sailing bat.” </p>

            <h3> Looking to the past to predict the future </h3>
            <p> Many of the scientists who spoke to Vox imagined a future environment where humans are no longer around. In doing so, they often drew from animals that existed on Earth before our time — perhaps these types of creatures could make a return down the line. If humans were to go extinct, our carbon emissions could still remain in the air for a long time, Alter, the Cal State professor of evolutionary biology, said. That could lead to boom times for plants, some of which can thrive in a CO2-dense atmosphere. The increased density and diversity of plants, in turn, might eventually increase the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere. Researchers have hypothesized that the growth of insects depends in part on the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere, which could lead to insects developing larger bodies, Alter says. So a future, oxygen-rich world is one that might be able to foster rabbit-sized praying mantises, or “ants as large as hummingbirds and dragonflies as large as hawks,” Alter said. It sounds extreme and these visions of the future are merely educated guesses. Then again, something like it has happened before: About 300 million years ago, in the Carboniferous era, the atmosphere was more than 30 percent oxygen, compared with 21 percent today. The fossil record reveals that insects around that time were far larger. Mairin Balisi, a paleoecologist at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, thinks about what type of apex predators might rise to the top of the food chain if humanity does blink out. To that end, she considers what predators existed before humans. “When we think about large predators in North America alone, we think of the gray wolves, the mountain lion, or the grizzly bear,” Balisi says. But large predators on the continent were much more common up until around 12,000 years ago, during the Pleistocene epoch or most recent Ice Age, with many species of saber-toothed cats and bone-crushing canines roaming the land. In a future world devoid of human beings, Balisi speculates, such large predators might be able to evolve once again. She is most confident about the saber-toothed cats, whose long, sharp teeth and bulky limbs “evolved independently multiple times in the last 40 million years.” If some lineage of felines persists eons into the future, history could very well repeat itself. </p>

            <h3> What future do we want? </h3>
            <p> Modern humans have only been around a few hundred thousand years, but what we do today is likely to have ripple effects for how the natural world looks tomorrow. The evolution of life depends on the “genetic and development toolkit” as we know it today, says Santana, the biologist at the University of Washington. Because there’s natural variation between animals, some are better at competing for resources and surviving, with the least helpful traits tending to fizzle out, while others crop up with new adaptations. As species continue to go extinct, whether due to habitat loss, agriculture, poaching, or human-caused climate change, many potential sources of diverse life are extinguished from the future, too. Scientists can still imagine a world where animals that are endangered today carry on and start new branches on the evolutionary tree. The future doesn’t have to belong to just the rats, pigeons, and insects. As long as manatees, polar bears, and monarch butterflies are around, for example, there remains the possibility of their descendants entering the picture sometime in the future. All of which is worth thinking about if we are to take full responsibility for our role in shaping what the planet will look and feel like long after we’re gone. When we imagine what creatures could come next, we can ask ourselves: What future do we want for the planet? How hard are we willing to work so that future generations of humans are still around to live alongside it? Giant bugs evolving in the future would be “really, really cool,” Alter said. Especially so, she added, “if humans are actually around to see them.” In the meantime, while it’s heartening to imagine how different species might bounce back in millions of years, “you don’t want to stop investing in the life that’s around us today,” said Mychajliw, the Middlebury paleoecologist. “There’s a lot we can do right now to ensure that we protect species, protect their genetic diversity, and protect their ability to respond to change.” </p>

            <h1> What will we look like in the future? </h1>
            <h3> Can we predict the future? </h3>
            <p> Many of the predictions for the future appearance of humans are based on past trends or on the fanciful idea that body parts used more frequently will get larger, or those that are used less will shrink. Will technology replace our need for strong limbs? Will too much television cause humans to evolve square eyes? Will we have the abnormally large brains commonly seen in science fiction movies? Most of these predictions are not based on the principles of biology and evolution. While we do not know what events will happen in the future that may affect the way we evolve, it is possible to set some constraints on what could happen. Some of the suggested changes are highlighted below. </p>

            <h4> Teeth </h4>
            <p> Although we have smaller jaws than in the past, and less room for all 32 adult teeth, it is probable that no significant change will occur in the number of teeth. However, if we change the way we eat (perhaps food in the future will be softer and require less chewing) then we may see some reduction in our jaws and more crowded teeth. </p>

            <h4> Large brains </h4>
            <p> Our brains are unlikely to get proportionally larger as any significant change in size would affect the ability for a baby’s head to pass through the pelvis during birth. The pelvis is a compromise between an upright posture, bipedalism and the size of the birth canal. Changing this would alter a woman’s ability to walk efficiently. </p>

            <h4> Smaller brains </h4>
            <p> Although the past trend within our species has generally been toward smaller brains, this was probably due to a decrease in body size. We may not use all of our brain today, but for a smaller brain to become common in our species there would have to be an advantage in such a characteristic. There is a direct relationship between our brain size and body size and this relationship is unlikely to change. </p>

            <h4> Body size </h4>
            <p> The trend over the last 300 years has been toward larger bodies, but this cannot continue indefinitely. Size cannot increase beyond a certain limit as the mechanical demands on the tissues of very large bodies are different to bodies of medium sizes. By significantly changing the size of the body, there would need to be a change in the shape of the body. </p>

            <h4> Thumb size </h4>
            <p> Recent reports show that there's a whole generation of teenagers with overdeveloped thumbs due to playing too many video games. Muscles are able to adapt through excessive physical use, but this is not genetic. An individual may develop such a characteristic but will not pass this on to any offspring. </p>

            <h4> A grand averaging? </h4>
            <p> Many geneticists claim that something new is happening in human evolution - something along the lines of a 'grand averaging' of our species. Basically, we are becoming more alike. Human evolution relies on the differences in our genes and in our ability to pass on these genetic differences (ie our breeding capabilities). Over time, the population should change as these differences become more apparent. If the genetic changes are great enough, a new species will arise. However, the three components required for evolution to occur - variation, natural selection and geographic isolation - have more or less disappeared from the equation. Humans can be considered a single genetic 'continent' - meaning that the world's population is mixing and is no longer just breeding within cultural or ethnic groups. It is suggested that, given enough time, the human race will start to look more and more alike, becoming the 'average' of all the current different physical appearances. </p>

            <h1> WWF Living Planet Report: Future of wildlife species in danger </h1>
            <h3> Nature is being destroyed by humans at a rate never seen before, according to the conservation group the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). </h3>
            <p> The WWF says population sizes of mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles have fallen by an average of 68 per cent in fewer than 50 years. That means globally more than two thirds of these animal numbers have been lost. The organisation's Living Planet Report says farming and deforestation are two of the major causes, while over-fishing is a big problem for life in the ocean and fresh waters. The WWF says the destruction of ecosystems means a million species (500,000 animals and plants, and 500,000 insects) will be threatened with extinction over the next 100 years. A loss of wildlife on this scale is normally seen over millions of years, which is why scientists are worried. Tanya Steele, Chief Executive at the WWF, said: "We are wiping wildlife from the face of the planet, burning our forests, polluting and over-fishing our seas and destroying wild areas. We are wrecking our world - the one place we call home - risking our health, security and survival here on Earth." The Living Planet Report is produced every two years by the WWF, along with experts it looks at how well the natural world is doing, what threats it faces and what humans need to do to fix the problems. </p>

           <h4> What is deforestation? Deforestation is the deliberate destruction of rainforest to make way for areas for human use, such as farmland for cattle, crops, or wood to be used for building. Many forests around the planet have been cleared in this way but the most famous is the Amazon rainforest - the world's largest tropical rainforest. </h4>

        <p> "In the UK we need to fast-track tough new nature laws that protect our wildlife at home and abroad, and with the COP26 summit in Glasgow next year the government has a huge opportunity to show global leadership in securing urgent commitments and action from world leaders," Tanya Steele said. "Only by putting the environment at the heart of our decision making can we build a safe and resilient future for nature, people and our planet." </p>

        <h2> Wildlife in decline </h2>
        <p> The WWF's Living Planet Report has analysed the populations of 21 thousand animal species around the world. Globally, the biggest loss of wildlife populations seen anywhere on Earth has been in the Caribbean and South America. In the country of Costa Rica, the numbers of Leatherback turtles seen at at Tortuguero beach have reduced by 84%. Leatherback turtles journey to the beaches to lay their eggs, however the eggs are often stolen and the turtles themselves are hunted for their shells which can be sold illegally. Warming oceans also force leatherbacks on longer more difficult journeys to feed. </p>

        <h4> What is an ecosystem? An ecosystem is a bubble of life it's made up of all of the living and non-living things in an area. This includes all of the plants, animals, that rely on the non living things such as water and soil to survive. </h4>

        <p> The report also blames the loss of wildlife globally on other human activities that have destroyed important ecosystems. Fresh water ecosystems are the most threatened on Earth, with too much fishing and structures such as dams affecting the food source for lots of animals. Research shows that almost one in three freshwater species now face extinction with larger animals such as hippos, river dolphins, sturgeon and beavers said to be the most at risk. Elsewhere in the Central African Republic, 98% of the African elephant population has been lost, meaning the animal has almost been completely wiped out from the country. </p>

        <h3> What can be done? </h3>
        <p> However there is some good news, the report says that many animal extinctions are preventable if we 'conserve and restore nature'. Conservation efforts have seen positive results around the world, with legal protection for forest elephants in Ghana, blacktail reef sharks in Australia and tigers in Nepal resulting in large increases of animal numbers. A conservation effort in Kenya and tougher action against poachers recently saw the population of elephant double in the country. Dr Andrew Terry from the Zoological Society of London worked on the research and says: "If nothing changes, populations will undoubtedly continue to fall, driving wildlife to extinction and threatening the integrity of the ecosystems on which we all depend. "But we also know that conservation works and species can be brought back from the brink. With commitment, investment and expertise, these trends can be reversed." </p>

        <h3> How food has an impact on the environment </h3>
        <p> The WWF says that changing our farming and the way we produce our food; tackling food waste and moving to healthier plant-based diets could all improve the planet's future. The report says: About 33% of land on our planet is now used for farming which can destroy wildlife habitats and ecosystems. Farming uses 75% of all fresh water used on Earth by humans. One third of food produced is never eaten. Roughly eight per cent of global green house gasses are caused by food waste as it decomposes. The WWF says: "food waste is a problem that we can address, and it would make a huge difference if we did." </p>

            <h1> Imagining the Animals of the Future </h1>
            <p> In an interview with the Saturday Evening Post on 27 October 1929, Albert Einstein addressed the controversial writer George Sylvester Viereck about his intuitions and inspirations in science: "Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world." For some scientists, this recognition of a certain kind of creativity as the driver of fundamental research is all the harder to accept, coming as it does from such an erudite mind. And yet many mathematicians and physicists have admitted to feeling inspired when they set out their working hypotheses or conjectures, which they then attempt to confirm (or not) using their favorite hypothetico-deductive method. Ad hoc testing of hypotheses using a reproducible and therefore verifiable technique is one of the characteristics of science. Trying to formulate a problem or hypothesis, sometimes virtually from scratch, can take some form of intuition, if only to overcome writer's block. In this sense, inspiration brings science and art closer together. Paradoxically, some practitioners of the so-called hard sciences readily compare their mathematical formulas and equations to a musical score. But can imagination also be of use in the life sciences, and if so, to what end? </p>

           <h4> Using the imagination to understand reality </h4>
           <p> In 1962, the eminent zoologists Gerolf Steiner, under the pseudonym Harald Stümpke, and Pierre-Paul Grassé, who signed the preface, wrote "The Snouters: Form and Life of the Rhinogrades," a stimulating book providing an extremely rigorous and academic account of a fictitious group of mammals characterized by a prominent nose-like feature, hence their common name, "snouters." As well as being a hoax (as Grassé warns: "biologist, my friend, remember that the best described facts are not always the truest"), this provocative book laid the foundations of what is known today as speculative biology. Speculative biology is an intellectual exercise that aims to imagine plausible life forms, either elsewhere in the Universe, or on a future Earth (it is then called speculative evolution). Although such speculation needs to be rigorous and take into account genuine data (such as that relating to natural selection), once turned into a fictionalized account, it simply becomes a work of science fiction. Since speculative biology does not claim to be a science, it cannot be considered as a pseudo-science. It is worth pointing out that, when fiction consists in rewriting the history of life (in which case it often begins with "What if...?"), speculative biology becomes alternative history, another genre of science fiction that has become fashionable in recent decades: in 1981, the Canadian paleontologist D.A. Russell made a detailed description of a new bipedal dinosaur better known today under the name Troodon. Intrigued by the large size of its braincase, Russell and his taxidermist colleague R. Seguin imagined an intelligent dinosaur in a counterfactual scenario where the species survived the Extinction Event and evolved until the present day.1 From the celebrated fur-bearing trout to the baby dragon skeleton currently on show at the French Natural History Museum's Gallery of Comparative Anatomy, naturalists have frequently resorted to chimeras to comprehend real organisms: classifying species and describing nature to understand it better also means reflecting on the concept of reality. Hoaxes in which the distinction between true and false is blurred are not only fun but can also take on a quasi-philosophical and beneficial role. Speculative biology creates fictitious organisms that shed light on real ones, just as speculative evolution invents chimeras of the future in a bid to explain the present. </p>

        <h4> Testing models and predicting potential discoveries </h4>
        <p> Works of speculative biology flourished in the 1980s and 1990s. In his illustrated speculative anthropology,2 the Scottish geologist Dougal Dixon explored the possibilities of the future evolution of humans, some inspired by stereotypes found in the science fiction novels of H.G. Wells, René Barjavel and others.3 Nine years earlier, the same prolific author published "After Man: A Zoology of the Future," where he imagined various forms of life on Earth in 50 million years from now.4 Plate tectonic models as well as considerations about climate change were included in his analysis. Dixon's work was later adapted for a documentary series called "The Future is Wild." While futurology was very popular at the time, a spate of films and series focused on "extraterrestrial" biology: "Alien Planet," another series, made an intelligent attempt to imagine complex and plausible ecosystems on a fictitious Earth-like planet, skilfully guiding the viewer from planetary science to speculative ecology. The astrophysicist Roland Lehoucq, the protohistorian Jean-Paul Demoule, the writer Pierre Bordage and myself stepped up the exercise when we wrote a speculative story5 in which an extraterrestrial species accidentally becomes intelligent enough to create its own history. This kind of "hard" science fiction, typical of the English-speaking world, which attempts to follow and disseminate current scientific knowledge (in the physical sciences, life sciences, humanities and social sciences, etc), evolves with major advances such as the detection of an ever-increasing number of exoplanets, or, here on Earth, the discovery of live or fossil extremophiles and species with extraordinary, almost "extraterrestrial," morphologies. This evolution also goes hand in hand with the growing awareness that life in the Universe should no longer be considered a miracle but rather as a common phenomenon. Demain, les Animaux du Futur ('Tomorrow, the Animals of the Future'), published jointly with the sculptor and paleo-artist Marc Boulay, ,is the result of some ten years of collaboration between art and science,6 This book of speculative evolution attempts to imagine life flourishing on Earth in ten million years' time, in the absence of humans. "In addition to the dissemination of knowledge, this exercise enabled us to test biomechanical models and predict potential discoveries: until it was unearthed, who could have imagined the existence of an 'improbable' dinosaur7 exhibiting features both of birds and of bats? As well as being a work of imagination that explores a tiny range among an almost infinite number of fictitious forms, we also wish to invite readers to think about the impact of humans on nature, while reminding them that the evolution of species is not predictable. Speculative biology can thus play a significant role. But does that make it publishable? In 1982, the description of D.A. Russell and R. Seguin's "reconstruction" of a fictitious dinosaur was published in the same scientific paper as that of the real dinosaur. Would any of today's scientific journals dare take up the challenge? </p>

        <h1> The Insect Effect: Insect Decline and the Future of Our Planet </h1>
        <h4> With an estimated 5.5 million species, insects are the most diverse group of animals on the planet.  More than one million have been named by scientists — and many more have yet to be discovered. In fact, insects account for 80% of animal life on Earth. </h4>

        <p> But, both the number and diversity of insects are declining around the globe due to habitat loss, pollution and climate change. Without widespread action, many of these important creatures face extinction within the next few decades. By making a few small changes in your life, you can help curb this worldwide problem. Watch the video and visit the links below to learn more about why insects are crucial to life on Earth and what you can do to help save these amazing creatures.  </p>

        <h2> What can I do to help? </h2>
        <p> Local, national and international efforts can help solve this crisis. Individuals can help through low-effort, impactful changes: Cultivating insect-friendly outdoor spaces, taking our pledge and spreading the word! Click the boxes below to learn more about how you can protect the insects.  </p>

        <h2> Why should I protect insects?  </h2>
        <p> While many insects can seem like pests, they provide a wide range of services to other plants and animals in our environment. In fact, a diverse range of insect species is critical to the survival of most life on Earth, including bats, birds, freshwater fishes and even humans! Along with plants, insects are at the foundation of the food web, and most of the plants and animals we eat rely on insects for pollination or food. For example, 96% of songbirds feed insects to their young. If a dollar value was put on the services insects provide, this would equal roughly $70 billion in the U.S. alone. These services include: Pollinating food crops and natural habitat: According to the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service, roughly 35% of the world’s food crops depend on pollinators to reproduce. That means you can thank a pollinator for about one of every three bites of food you eat. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, more than 100,000 different animal species play roles in pollinating the 250,000 kinds of flowering plants on Earth, with insects like bees, wasps, moths, butterflies, flies and beetles being the most common. Additionally, some insects are natural predators to pests that may harm food crops. Removing waste: Some insects are known as decomposers, meaning they break down dead materials like fallen leaves and animal carcasses and turn them into simpler materials, making nutrients available to primary producers like plants and algae. In other words, decomposers are nature’s own recycling system. Controlling pests: Only a very small fraction of insects in the world are considered by humans to be pests, meaning they cause harm to people, plants, animals and buildings. While insect pest control costs the U.S. economy billions of dollars annually, this number would be much higher if it weren’t for the countless beneficial insects that serve as natural predators to pest species, like fire ants and mosquitoes. Additionally, some parasitic insects like small wasps lay their eggs inside pest species, driving their population down. To adequately control pests, we need beneficial insects. Providing nutrition for wildlife: Insects are the primary menu item for many reptiles, birds and amphibians. If insect populations continue to decline, some food webs might collapse entirely. We also depend on insects for silk, dyes, honey and medical and genetic research. But, aside from the services insects provide, they are simply fascinating animals that spark curiosity in humans, especially children. These incredible creatures exhibit many extraordinary behaviors that are unthinkable in other forms of life and have inspired technology that we use today, like drones!
