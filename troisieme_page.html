            <h1> The Future of Robotics: How Will Robots Change The World? </h1>
            <p> In 2030, robots could be exploring alien worlds and performing surgeries from halfway around the globe. Robotics is one of the fastest evolving fields of technology, and it’s shaping the future of travel, work and exploration. Peripheral advancements in AI, computing and IoT are helping elevate things even further. Robotics holds some exciting innovations that will play a central role in daily life worldwide.  </p>

            <h2> Transportation </h2>
            <p> Few technologies in recent history have been as highly anticipated as autonomous vehicles. Ambitious scientists and engineers have pursued self-driving car technology for centuries. In fact, in the 1500s, Leonardo Da Vinci designed a cart that could move on its own. DARPA’s autonomous vehicle challenge in the 2000s sparked a wave of modern R&D surrounding self-driving autos. Self-driving cars get smarter every year, yet they remain rare on the roads in the 2020s. What makes robotic transportation a challenge is AI computing and human randomness. Robots work best with structured, predictable data. Human behavior is never certain. Today’s autonomous vehicle researchers are developing AI models that can accurately and consistently respond to obstacles on the road, especially pedestrians. Throughout the 2020s, this unique robotics niche may finally get “over the hump” and go mainstream. Tesla has blazed a trail for rudimentary autonomous vehicle tech with its autopilot mode. This developed public policy to regulate self-driving cars and increased public adoption. Other leading self-driving car companies are making substantial headway, as well. Waymo began operating its autonomous taxi service in Phoenix in 2020. In 2022, the company announced it would be removing test drivers from the vehicles. In the 2030s, robot-powered vehicles may be on the road in major cities worldwide. These cars will make travel more accessible, reduce emissions and improve policing behaviors.  </p>

            <h2> Education </h2>
            <p> Educational robotics is experiencing some fun and exciting innovations right now. The COVID-19 pandemic led educators and parents to analyze education and the role of technology in learning. Robots have long since been a valuable learning tool in classrooms, especially for STEM education. This role will only grow over the years and decades ahead. One of the most fascinating educational robots is Moxie, developed by Embodied. This educational robot made headlines when it was released in 2021, gaining attention for its unique design and use of AI. Moxie is designed to be a socialization robot for children. It helps young kids learn social skills, empathy, critical thinking and communication. Children can play games with Moxie, read with it or even engage in natural, ongoing conversations. The robot’s friendly animated face displays a range of facial expressions. It remembers previous conversations and can recognize kids’ faces, allowing them to form a real bond with it. Companion robots like Moxie will likely become much more popular in the years ahead. This is especially probable with the rise of remote learning. In the future, teachers and instructors may be robots. At CES 2020, Samsung’s STAR Labs announced a groundbreaking project called NEON. The project consists of lifelike AI models with unique personalities, specialties and even full physical appearances. The NEONs are still in very early development, but Samsung hopes they will one day take on everyday roles, including acting as teachers.  </p>

            <h2> Industry </h2>
            <p> Industrial robotics is booming right now. In fact, the current challenges facing manufacturing and construction are driving robotics development. For example, the construction industry is short an estimated 2.2 million workers, but demand for new homes and infrastructure has rarely been higher. Manufacturing is in a similar position with over 2.1 million unfilled jobs, accounting for $1 trillion in lost revenue. Robots are the perfect solution to these challenges. Manufacturing was one of the first applications for robotics, and it remains a strong candidate for increased automation. The structured, repetitive nature of many manufacturing tasks makes it easy to integrate robotics. AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) are advancing to a point where manufacturing could be 100% autonomous by the 2030s, from assembly to quality control. Jobs in this sector will shift to robot maintenance and operations. Robots are also improving the lives of construction workers and everyday people. For example, startups are hard at work developing autonomous construction vehicles. These machines will help workers do their jobs more safely and efficiently. Autonomous cars could even reduce stress and injury rates. In fact, a Chinese construction company made a critical advancement in 2021. Robotic paving vehicles resurfaced a stretch of China’s busiest highway, the Nanjing-Shanghai expressway. One of the most exciting advances in construction robotics is 3D printing. This technology could transform the industry. Construction 3D printing has been around for several years now, but only in the 2020s did it begin to take off. In 2021, 3D printing company ICON announced it would be developing the world’s largest 3D printed neighborhood in Austin, Texas, set to break ground in 2022. This project consists of 100 homes with sustainable materials and solar panels integrated into the roofs. This first major success in construction 3D printing is crucial. This technology will be paramount in the future, especially as demand for new homes continues to rise worldwide.  </p>
                
            <h2> Medicine </h2>
            <p> Healthcare is one of the frontiers of robotics today, with innovations pushing the boundaries of science and engineering. Robots will transform medicine in the years and decades ahead, with everything from remote robotic surgeries to AI nurses. By 2030, robots could be a commonplace sight in the halls of hospitals around the globe. One of the most fascinating niches of medical robotics is robot surgery. Patients might die in some parts of the world because they don’t have access to a doctor who knows how to treat them. Remote robotic surgeries could change that. In 2022, researchers at MIT announced a new system that would let doctors remotely treat stroke and aneurysm patients. Time is critical with conditions like these — patients can’t wait for a doctor to fly halfway around the world. MIT’s remote robotic surgery system could save lives. Robots are helping out in other ways, too. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a surge in demand for UV disinfection bots. These autonomous machines rove through buildings killing bacteria and sterilizing surfaces using UV light. This protects everyone working in and inhabiting hospitals and reduces the spread of disease. Robots may even begin assisting nurses in hospitals and eldercare centers. In 2019, a team of researchers from Trinity College Dublin tested a prototype of a nursing robot named “Stevie” at an elder care center in Washington, D.C. Stevie could play games with residents, talk with them and even participate in karaoke night. This robot is unique because its AI also has built-in care features. For example, if a patient says a keyword like “help,” the robot will call for medical assistance. In the future, robots like Stevie could help promote socialization and mental wellness in patient care while also assisting nurses.  </p>
            
            <h2> Exploration </h2>
            <p> Robotics is driving exciting new advances in exploration, from the depths of the sea to the surface of Mars and beyond. New frontiers of exploration are particularly challenging because they involve areas where humans simply can’t go without the help of advanced technology. Some may be surprised to hear that Earth’s oceans are one of the least explored places in our corner of the solar system. Scientists have studied less than 20% of the world’s oceans. By comparison, we have photographed 99% of the moon’s surface. There are likely entire species in the darkest depths of the sea that scientists haven’t even discovered yet. Robots are helping explorers traverse these realms of the deep, where water pressure is far too high for scuba divers to withstand. Among these incredible projects is the Orpheus robot from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI). Orpheus is designed to explore underwater regions between 20,000 and 36,000 feet below the surface. The data and images these robots report will help scientists study the deepest corners of the ocean. Orpheus could pave the way for exploring other planets and moons suspected to have water on them, including Saturn’s moon Titan and Jupiter’s moon Europa. Robots could very well discover alien life on these worlds.  </p>

            <h2> The Future of Robotics and Our World </h2>
            <p> Robots could someday be our drivers, companions, co-workers, teachers, surgeons and exploration pioneers. The capabilities of this technology will only grow as scientists and engineers continue to innovate and evolve robotics. Robots are already a central part of everyday life in many capacities. They will likely improve the quality of life for billions of people and even help us reach new horizons on our planet and beyond. </p>

            <h1> The Future of Medical Tech </h1>
            <p>  The future of medical tech is already here The future of medicine is shaping up with the advances in the digital forefront, including artificial intelligence, AR/VR, robotics, 3D printing, nanotechnology, and so much more that’s yet to come. So, with this article, we are exploring how AI and other technologies will impact the medical industry! </p>
    
            <h2> The Benefiters Of Technology — Is Everyone Rich Enough? </h2>
            <p> When it comes down to tech evolution in the medical world, it will directly influence one’s ability to access medical care. For instance, the patients can now connect with medical professionals through telemedicine standards, but it’s critical to identify who will benefit from it the most. In simpler words, we must decipher who has the luxury to procure new medical technology and who will be left behind with decade-old machines? To begin with, the poverty threshold is different for everyone — in 2018, around 12.9% of women and 10.6% of men in the U.S. were living in poverty. Similarly, single families without women accounted for 12.7% in the poverty baseline, and 4.7% of married couples were living in poverty. Not to forget, around four million disabled people are living in poverty. Having seen these stats, whom do you think will have the resources to avail these? Truth be told, most medical tech products aren’t affordable, and everyone living below the poverty line will need access to the technology since they don’t have the resources to acquire them. In fact, even if they purchase the equipment, they will needinternet access, which isn’t easy, given the budget constraints. To summarize, anyone who doesn’t have a trust fund won’t afford a medical expert to examine them through telemedicine — so, what will fix this catastrophic situation? </p>


            <h2> • Artificial Intelligence </h2>
            <p> Artificial intelligence has the capacity to redesign the medical industry, and the AI algorithms can mine the medical records, create medicines, and design the treatment plans quicker as compared to the medical options available on the current palette. For instance, DeepMind has launched the AI technology for breast cancer analysis which managed to outshine the human radiologists to identify breast cancer by 11.5%. </p>

            <h2> • Biohacking </h2>
            <p> One innovation in Medical Tech is biohacking — it is a broad term surfacing Medtech. It is used for a variety of activities,from doing experiments on bio-organisms to tracking your sleep and diet. It also may include transfusion of younger blood to an aged person to decrease aging, known as young blood transfusion. In fact, some biohackers are experimenting with their bodies with the hope of boosting their physical and cognitive behavior. They are using biohacking out of laboratories and institutions. They form one branch of Transhumanism, which is a movement that says human beings can and should use technology to enhance their species. In the area of biohacking, some are highly qualified persons and have Ph.D. degrees in science, while the others are amateur ones. Hence there is diversity in methods that are used by biohackers because there are all types of biohackers in the field of biohacking, from very educated ones to amateurs. It is quite tricky to understand the types of hacks they use, and what makes them different from the traditional medicines, and how safe according to laws they are. However, biohacking is a great revolution and is now appearing more and more in medicalheadlines. Biohacking surely is going to bring a great change in Medical Tech, especially for the ones who don’t have the resources to acquire expensive medical products. </p>

            <h2> • Virtual Reality </h2>
            <p> VR is undeniably changing the ways patients are treated and how doctors go ahead with the treatment. Future surgeons are being trained to practice operations through virtual reality. For this reason, companies like ImmersiveTouch and Osso VR are already developing software programs. In addition, the traditional surgeons were outweighed by VR-trained surgeons by 230% when it comes down to performance. In addition, it’s making treatments more accurate and faster. Currently, women are being helped with VR headsets and wearables to visualize peaceful and serene landscapes to help them through labor pain. Having said that, this technology will obviously reduce the time needed to be spent in the hospital, making it a much better choice for people with limited resources. </p>

        <h1> What Will Video Games Be Like In The Future? </h1>
        <p> Video games have broken down barriers between platforms and as well as people. Friends from any corner of the world can connect in real-time and enjoy the gaming experience together. Throughout their long journey over the decades, they have widened human imagination with the inclusion of new themes, characters, hardware, and technology. As per a recent study by Nielsen, 82% of the worldwide consumers played different kinds of video games during the COVID-19 lockdown. According to industry experts, video games have undergone remarkable transformation down the years. This industry is improving and trying out new things every single day. This article takes a close look at finding out what the future of gaming would possibly look like in years to come. </p>

        <h2> How Will Augmented Reality Be Applied? </h2>
        <p> Augmented reality would be a great leap in the future of gaming. It’s more accessible than virtual reality. This is because it makes use of the existing physical environment. Digital characters and physical locations are combined. Think Pokémon: Go! It also brings together the two opposite worlds of virtual and reality. While playing augmented reality video games, players can move out and interact with reality. They can feel the real world and also form social connections with other players. Since the attention span of people is decreasing day by day, video games need to be developed which would give the players immediate outcomes of their behaviors. They can see the results of the game in no time. Augmented reality implants might allow players to play a game just by using their eyes, through augmented reality implants. This feature of augmented reality games waits to be manipulated in the next few years. </p>

        <h2> What Is The Future of Virtual Reality? </h2>
        <p> In virtual reality games, players normally use VR headsets, gloves, hand-controllers, etc. The headsets are quite bulky which makes the players feel uncomfortable while playing. This interrupts their experience. The future of gaming would see many upgrades of VR hardware and technology. Though haptic sensors are being tested, it has to be updated so that players can feel specific sensations while playing the game. In the future, we can see a better version of eye-tracking and audio in such games. The upgrades of the resolution would also work wonders. VR games also don’t allow the players to interact with their real, physical environment. The players feel as if they are cut off from their immediate surroundings. While some players might prefer the fantasy world that the video games create, other players might prefer to be connected with their real, physical surroundings or environment. </p>
        
        <h2> How Can Mixed Reality Be Employed? </h2>
        <p> The inclusion of elements of hyper-reality shall bring about immense change in the gaming world. Hyperreality offers location-based entertainment to the players. It is a blend of virtual and physical realities. Whatever the players will see in their headsets will correspond to their geographical or physical space. This is a step that goes beyond or ahead of what virtual reality offers. Players will no longer use physical hardware. They would be offered a magical experience through tactile sensations in the game. </p>

        <h2> How Will Artificial Intelligence Change The Future Of Gaming? </h2>
        <p> With the constant development of artificial intelligence, the industry of video games is bound to be bigger and better. Artificial intelligence can use the data of each player and customize the game for them. Game engineers might focus on developing player pattern learning which would also lead to a customized game, based on the preferences of each player. Artificial intelligence is applied in the form of Non-Player Characters (NPC). These characters are generally programmed and they function based on a set of codes. In the future, the game engineers might add some variety in the codes. Every virtual character follows a particular script and a behavior tree. The script and the behavior tree enable each character to process or make complex decisions in the course of the game. Some modifications might be brought about in these with advanced and more comprehensive artificial intelligence. Some developments are already done to provide limited autonomy to the NPCs. It has been observed that if the NPCs are allowed to function freely and given a mind of their own, the gaming experience is less enjoyable. In that case, the NPCs might behave and function in unpredictable ways which might create a glitch in the game. In the future of gaming we might come across NPCs who are more sophisticated and upgraded. They will be made believable. The script and behavior tree might be improved so that the virtual characters come alive. The aim of the game should be to provide an excellent gaming experience to the players. The players shouldn’t be feeling that they are playing with bots and not real human beings. Artificial intelligence can even be manipulated to generate various game assets. Presently these are human-generated but with technology nothing is impossible. Artificial intelligence can also be helpful in content generation. This would give the players a fresh experience at each level of the game. Artificial intelligence might also help to collect data from the players which could be used for analytics as well. Each player’s performance and game behavior can be stored and accessed as per requirement. The game designers can incorporate all this information into different algorithms. This would be useful in giving a personal, customized touch to the game. The different levels of the game shall be personalized based on the prediction of what a particular player’s behavior would be like on reaching a specific level. This would be a massive technological improvement and shall enhance a player’s experience to a great extent. </p>

        <h2> How Can The Graphics Develop? </h2>
        <p> Nowadays developers are employing the technique of Ray Tracing. It enables the movement of the light in the game to be more natural and realistic. A lot of improvement can be seen in the usage of this technique in the future. The virtual characters might be more realistic. The virtual environment shall be more playful and entertaining. If the virtual characters are made more human-like, then the player shall be able to connect with them in a better way. High quality and upgraded graphics will raise the overall standard of the games. </p>

        <h2> What’s The Scope Of Online Game Streaming In The Future? </h2>
        <p> The online availability and streaming of video games have attracted millions of gamers. Players can connect within each other, play together, and have fun. Many online websites stream games from their networks, allowing people all over the world to play at the same time. Multiplayer games are likely to increase with greater accessibility and involvement by the players. </p>

        <h2> What’s The Future Of Mobile Gaming? </h2>
        <p> Mobiles have reached every nook and cranny of the world. This creates a scope for video games to expand and reach a wider audience even more. Network and telecommunication providers are working hard to provide better connectivity. Soon we will be getting better speed and faster uploads and downloads. In the future, we might see considerable improvements in the gaming apps so that they work fine on all mobile platforms. Players are sure to enjoy playing video games on their phones much more than they do now. </p>

        <h2> How Can Video Games Be Used For Educational Purposes? </h2>
        <p> Many teachers use video games as an educational tool today. Video games work great in developing imagination and creativity in children. It secures their attention, engages them, and creates a lasting effect. New and interesting themes have been added to the video games to make them more appealing and suitable for children of all ages. In future years, we might see the inclusion of different genres as well. The game developers might even include wider representation of people based on their gender, orientation and ethnicity. Children will enjoy learning new things if video games are made more interactive and child-centric. Video games will be very helpful to teach difficult concepts in a simple way. Children will learn easily and quickly. It will also improve their concentration level and eye-hand coordination. </p>

        <p> Video games have pushed boundaries and dissolved borders. It has become a dominant form of entertainment competing with online movie streaming. The developers are constantly improving and adding new features to the games to make them more attractive to the players. Big tech companies are developing new and unique gaming products. Video games occupy an important part of our leisure time. With the continuous advancements in this field, we can surely hope for a bright future of gaming with something big in store for us. </p>

        <h1> Technology in schools: Future changes in classrooms </h1>
        <p> Technology has the power to transform how people learn - but walk into some classrooms and you could be forgiven for thinking you were entering a time warp. There will probably be a whiteboard instead of the traditional blackboard, and the children may be using laptops or tablets, but plenty of textbooks, pens and photocopied sheets are still likely. And perhaps most strikingly, all desks will face forwards, with the teacher at the front. The curriculum and theory have changed little since Victorian times, according to the educationalist and author Marc Prensky. "The world needs a new curriculum," he said at the recent Bett show, a conference dedicated to technology in education. "We have to rethink the 19th Century curriculum." Most of the education products on the market are just aids to teach the existing curriculum, he says, based on the false assumption "we need to teach better what we teach today". He feels a whole new core of subjects is needed, focusing on the skills that will equip today's learners for tomorrow's world of work. These include problem-solving, creative thinking and collaboration. </p>

        <h2> 'Flipped' classrooms </h2>
        <p> One of the biggest problems with radically changing centuries-old pedagogical methods is that no generation of parents wants their children to be the guinea pigs. Mr Prensky he thinks we have little choice, however: "We are living in an age of accelerating change. We have to experiment and figure out what works." "We are at the ground floor of a new world full of imagination, creativity, innovation and digital wisdom. We are going to have to create the education of the future because it doesn't exist anywhere today." He might be wrong there. Change is already afoot to disrupt the traditional classroom. The "flipped" classroom - the idea of inverting traditional teaching methods by delivering instructions online outside of the classroom and using the time in school as the place to do homework - has gained in popularity in US schools. The teacher's role becomes one of a guide, while students watch lectures at home at their own pace, communicating with classmates and teachers online. Salman Khan is one of the leading advocates of "flipped" classrooms, having first posted tutorials in maths for his young cousins on YouTube in 2004. Their huge popularity led to the creation of the not-for-profit Khan Academy, offering educational videos with complete curricula in maths and other subjects. The project has caught the eye of the US Department of Education, which is currently running a $3m (£1.9m) trial to gauge the effectiveness of the method. Now the idea has reached the UK. </p>

        <h2> Teachers 'surprised' </h2>
        <p> Mohammed Telbany heads the IT department at Sudbury Primary School in Suffolk. He has been experimenting with the "flipped" classroom and recently expanded it to other lessons. "The teachers facilitate, rather than standing in front of the children telling them what to do, and the children just come in and get on with what they are doing," he says. "It has surprised the teachers that the kids can excel on their own, with minimal teaching intervention." In the developing world where, according to some estimates, up to 57 million children are unable to attend primary school, the idea of children learning without much adult intervention is a necessity not a luxury. Prof Sugata Mitra, from Newcastle University, has been experimenting with self-learning since his famous hole-in-the-wall computer experiments in the slums of Delhi in 1999. He was amazed at how quickly the children learned how to use the machines with no adult supervision or advice. From that was born the idea of "cloud grannies" - retired professionals from the UK, mentoring groups of children in India via Skype. He won the $1m Ted prize in 2013 to build a series of self-organising learning environments in both the UK and India. In January he completed the last of seven such units - a striking solar-powered glass building amid the lush vegetation of the village of Gocharan in West Bengal. There will be no teachers and up to 40 children can participate when it suits them. They will have the internet at their disposal and will work in small groups. E-mediators will mentor the children via Skype. Dr Suneeta Kulkarni, research director of the School in the Cloud project, said children would "engage in a variety of activities that are driven by their interest and curiosity", with games typically tried first. The children will also be asked "big questions" that they can answer online. "At yet other times these questions emerge from what the children 'wonder' about. It is also where the grannies or e-mediators are expected to play a significant role," she said.  </p>

        <h2> Classroom games </h2>
        <p> When Canadian teacher and computer programmer Shawn Young wanted to spruce up his lessons, his first thought was gaming. It was a platform many of his students were familiar with and something that was proven to engage children. But it also had a bad reputation in teaching circles - thought to be too violent, addictive and without educational merit. Some early attempts to integrate educational content within games failed. But what makes Classcraft different is that it is not about content - it is more a behaviour-management and motivation tool. "The teacher teaches as normal. Teachers can offer pupils points for good behaviour, asking questions, or working well in their teams and it gives them access to real life powers," Mr Young says. Those powers are decided by the teachers and may include handing in homework a day late. There are also penalties for those not concentrating in class, turning up late or being disruptive. Children play the game in teams, which means a lost point affects the entire group, and encourages them to work together. "It is being used in a school in Texas which has a mix of white, Mexican and Afro-Americans. They would never normally speak to each other," said Mr Young. Teachers using the system - some 100,000 have signed up since it launched in August - have noted not just better interaction between pupils, but better classroom engagement and motivation. "As in other games there are sometimes random events, which could be something like everyone having to speak like a pirate for the day or the teacher having to sing a song in class. The kids love it." </p>

        <h1> Artificial Intelligence And The Future Of Humans </h1>
        <p> Artificial intelligence is already impacting virtually every industry and every human being. This incredible technology has brought many good and questionable things into our lives, and it will create an even bigger impact in the next two decades.

            According to Ray Kurzweil, one of the most-known futurists, computers will have the same level of intelligence as humans by 2029. Kurzweil stated to Futurism, "2029 is the consistent date I have predicted for when an AI will pass a valid Turing test and therefore achieve human levels of intelligence. I have set the date 2045 for the 'Singularity' which is when we will multiply our effective intelligence a billion fold by merging with the intelligence we have created." However remarkable this technology may be, it doesn't come without some major concerns for humanity. Movies like Ex Machina, Transcendence and Her show us the dark side of AI reaching human-level consciousness. There have also been some serious concerns coming from scientists, politicians and technologists that should not be taken lightly.

            AI will make most people better off, but its advances will also affect what it truly means to be human in the 21st century. This article explores the juxtaposition of the risks and benefits of what is about to come. </p>

        <h2> The Bright Side Of The AI Future </h2>

        <p> • Precision medicine. AI is currently in use to understand how a person's genetics, environment and lifestyle can help determine the best approach to prevent or treat a certain disease. Digital therapeutics, custom-designed drugs and improved diagnosis are already making treatments more affordable, accessible, accurate and are helping humans live longer and healthier lives. </p>
        <p> • Driverless cars. Deep learning excels at tasks involving pattern recognition, and modern cars will be better than humans when it comes to perception, prediction and planning on the fly. IEEE Spectrum noted that one forecast has autonomous cars handling 70% of all miles driven by 2035. Fatal driving accidents are projected to drop dramatically as autonomous vehicles become mainstream and make deaths from driver error a thing of the past. </p>
        <p> • Virtual assistants. AI virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa and other programs that use natural language processing to understand and perform tasks given by humans are taking off. Voice technology is already making life easier and is in wide use, but it will play a far more critical part in our lives in the future when virtual assistants are connected to robots and are part of the singularity. </p>
        <p> • Implantables. The wide adoption of brain-machine interfaces will lead to a massive expansion of human intelligence and could allow humans to solve many medical conditions including paralysis, blindness, anxiety and addiction. Using implantables to reprogram underlying human biology can allow us to augment and upgrade ourselves in a few short years. For example, a monkey with implants in his brain made by Elon Musk's company, Neuralink, is now able to play Pong using just his thoughts. Imagine what humans could be able to do once this is commercialized. </p>

        <h2> The Dark Side Of The AI Future </h2>
        <p> • Mass surveillance. The broad use of AI by big technology companies has brought upon the destruction of digital privacy. China's social credit system expands that surveillance to not only the digital world but to all aspects of life, judging citizens' behavior and trustworthiness and placing draconian control on their population. With the advent of the Covid-19 passports, many fear that this is the first step toward rolling out this type of control across the Western world. </p>
        <p> • Modern warfare. In the next big war, AI could be the determining factor between winning and losing. With unmanned underwater vehicles, constellations of smart robotic devices, drones, robots and precision-guided missiles, modern warfare supremacy will be decided by technology. Robots are quicker, stronger, more accurate and follow orders much better than humans and could make soldiers obsolete. </p>
        <p> • Massive job losses. Udacity CEO Gabe Dalporto told Time that he estimates a billion people will lose their jobs due to AI by 2030 and that the Covid-19 pandemic has only accelerated this trend. In terms of scale, these widespread job losses could rival the move away from agricultural labor during the 1900s in the United States and Europe. Unfortunately, this technological trend is inevitable, and it will likely increase inequality and place power in the hands of a few. </p>
        <p> • Socioeconomic inequality. With millions of low-skill to medium-skill jobs gone, the income gap between middle-skill and high-skill labor will be enormous. According to the U.N., "71% of the world's population live in countries where inequality has grown," and "the share of income going to the top 1% of the global population increased in 46 out of 57 countries with data." A scenario of the class-based divide between the masses who work for algorithms, a privileged technology class that designs and trains algorithmic systems and an ultra-wealthy aristocracy that owns the algorithms is not too far-fetched. </p>
        
        <h2> Bottom Line </h2>
        <p> With the pace of technology innovation ever increasing, it is important to be aware of the upcoming disruptions and not just blindly enjoy the benefits that AI brings. Computer superintelligence could threaten our very existence, and even if it doesn't, there are still big issues that need to be resolved if we can responsibly bring forth the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
