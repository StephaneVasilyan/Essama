            <h1> Envision 2050: The Future of Oceans </h1>
            <p> This article first appeared on Ensia, a magazine showcasing environmental solutions in action that is powered by the Institute on the Environment at the University of Minnesota. Envision 2050 is a yearlong series imagining tomorrow’s human systems through the eyes of today’s experts. ♦ Oceans cover more than two thirds of Earth’s surface. They are home to millions of species, provide a key source of protein to people on every continent, and play an enormous role in regulating our planet’s climate, water cycle and more. They also are facing tremendous disruption from human action, from altered temperature and circulation to overfishing to acidification to plastic pollution. What kind of oceans will we pass along to future generations of humans and other living things? The answer to that question starts with two others: What kind of oceans would we like to pass along? And what would it take to do so? For this fourth installment of our Envision 2050 series (read the first three here), Ensia asked seven individuals with special connections to the ocean to share their hopes for the world’s oceans — and what it would take to achieve them. Here are their responses: </p>

            <h3> Margaret Leinen: Directrice de Keep Learning , Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego </h3>
            <p> Put simply, the oceans are key to the future of our planet and its health. My hope is that by 2050 we can all look back and say that in 2015 we began to make the serious changes necessary to address — and even reverse — the challenges facing the oceans: pollution, rising seas, ocean warming, oxygen depletion, and acidification, to name a few. These issues are not isolated in their reach. The food and precious resources the oceans provide to global society have been bountiful, but we see them diminishing. We must act strategically going forward. It serves all of us, as a global society, to maintain the stability of the oceans as a natural system. My colleagues at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego, and across the oceanographic and earth science communities have employed instruments and observation networks to explore the oceans and track the troubling trends afflicting the ocean’s habitats, from coral reefs in decline to low-oxygen zones that choke out productive ecosystems. One urgent area of concern is the world’s rising seas. No longer an issue isolated to far-off island nations, sea-level rise will be a sobering wake-up call for many in our crowded coastal cities by 2050. We must act now to develop adaptation solutions for the global community. We at Scripps are working with the world’s leading thinkers and researchers to share knowledge and develop sea-level rise solutions. From these efforts we look to develop a plan of action to help cities and states adapt to rising seas. By 2050 our seas will be viewed as more than a platform for tourism and recreation and rather an ocean for solutions. Our sustainable energy solutions will be aided by marine algae–derived biofuel, while new medicines to treat modern diseases will be derived from sea creatures with novel chemical structures. There is still so much we don’t know. We need to keep learning about our water world, especially the deep sea and the immense role of the oceans in global climate change. All of us need to do our part. We are all stewards of the ocean and the planet. We must continue to explore. We must continue to study the things we don’t yet understand and protect the resources we have for future generations. Shared oceans, protected by all, hold the solutions for the planet’s future. </p>

            <h3> Michael Conathan: Promoting a Robust Blue Economy Director of Ocean Policy, Center for American Progress </h3>
            <p> While humans rely on the ocean to support our existence, we must learn to use the maritime domain in ways that reverse the global decline in ocean health and ensure that the ocean’s bounty is available for future generations. One way the United States has already begun to do this is through ocean planning, an idea similar to traditional land use planning. The National Ocean Policy established by President Barack Obama provides U.S. regions with support to develop “regional ocean plans” that empower local ocean stakeholders to represent their interests in decision making. Other nations, including China, Australia, the Philippines and various European nations, have implemented similar practices. Yet, to truly achieve a sustainable vision for the future of the world’s oceans, we must go beyond simple spatial planning. The ocean provides a great deal more than fish, fossil fuels and free trade. This generation’s legacy must include protecting and restoring robust, functioning marine ecosystems. The oceans make the planet’s climate livable, absorbing 90 percent of the additional heat trapped by our ever-thickening atmospheric blanket of carbon pollution. They generate more than half of the oxygen we breathe. And they serve as the primary source of protein for over a billion people. As oceans warm and acidify as a result of runaway carbon pollution, we put all of these ecosystem benefits at risk. Yet none of them will continue unless we incorporate their financial worth into the cost of doing business. Putting a price tag on the value of a healthy marine environment will help political and business leaders arrive at more efficient and more sustainable decisions and develop a new Blue Economy that links economic growth with ocean health. Moving development away from the dirty industries of the past that profit from degrading our natural resources and toward a future that promotes efficiency and environmental stewardship can be a win for the planet and our pocketbooks. </p>  

            <h3> Alexandra Cousteau: Abundance, Diversity, Purity Explorer, Filmmaker and Water Advocate </h3>
            <p> My vision for the oceans in 2050 is one of abundance, diversity, purity. While most predictions point to a darker future for the oceans, I do believe that it is possible to have more fish, sea turtles, dolphins, whales and sharks in our lifetimes. But we have to start acting now. Scientists report that the amount of fish caught began declining for the first time in recorded history just a few decades ago. That’s obviously bad news, but it is also recent news. If we take action quickly we can have a huge effect on helping the oceans rebound. The Cousteau family has been chronicling the stories of the oceans for three generations. We’ve seen the changes, we’ve told the stories. Yet in spite of all the damage that humankind has done to the oceans, I remain optimistic. The oceans are a shared resource covering 71 percent of the planet. They play a central role in the world’s natural systems, like regulating our climate and absorbing carbon dioxide. Over a billion people, including some of the poorest in the world, depend on the oceans and wild seafood for survival. Restoring abundance to the world’s fisheries is important not only for the planet but also for the people who live on it. To that end, I have taken action with [the international organization] Oceana to tackle these issues by focusing on the importance of science in identifying problems and solutions. We need to accomplish three goals: stop overfishing, reduce bycatch and protect marine habitat. Scientists working closely with economists, lawyers and policy experts can achieve tangible results for the oceans. Examples in the Philippines and other countries have demonstrated how to rebuild fish populations: avoid overfishing by setting responsible catch limits, minimize the capture of vulnerable animals like turtles or juvenile fish, and protect habitat. With science-based management in place, the fish, the ecosystem they depend on, and the people whose livelihoods depend on both will rebound. By promoting responsible fishing practices, we can protect the oceans while helping to reduce poverty in coastal communities. If we can save the oceans, we can help feed the world. </p>

            <h3> David Sheppard: Rays of Hope Director-General, Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme </h3>
            <p> It’s easy to be pessimistic about the future of the world’s oceans. The 20th century lay to rest myths that the oceans were so vast and their living resources so huge that human activities could never make a significant impact. Instead, we saw destruction in the stocks of the great whales, the collapse of numerous fisheries as more fishing vessels poured onto the seas with increasingly sophisticated technologies, and the creation of dead zones as industrial effluents smothered and poisoned previously rich, productive waters. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report offers little reassurance. Half of all carbon dioxide emissions since 1750 came in the last 40 years with oceans absorbing 90 percent of the resulting heat energy, setting in temperature rises and ocean acidification that will continue for decades even if emissions ceased tomorrow. At current rates, shallow water tropical coral reefs will have vanished by 2050 along with a myriad of species and food for millions of people. But there are rays of hope — especially in the Pacific island countries and territories with enormous Exclusive Economic Zones effectively making them Large Ocean States with stewardship responsibilities for over 10 percent of the global ocean. Large Marine Protected Areas in the Phoenix Islands of Kiribati and the Coral Sea of New Caledonia protect over 1.5 million square kilometers (580,000 square miles), and a sophisticated planning exercise is underway to protect most of the 1.1 million-square-kilometer (420,000-square-mile) Cook Islands Marine Park. Palau is banning foreign fishing fleets from its 600,000 square-kilometer (230,000-square-mile) EEZ, and shark sanctuaries have been established in the waters of the Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, Cook Islands and Tokelau. Alone, these bold actions won’t prevent the overwhelming impacts of climate change, but by reducing key stressors such as overfishing, habitat loss and inappropriate development, they give marine biodiversity a better chance. They act as a signal of hope: If developing countries can set aside vast tracts of ocean for conservation, then developed countries can also take a similar approach for the benefit of future generations. </p>

            <h3> Susan Avery: A Key Cog President and Director, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution </h3>
            <p> I bring an atmospheric scientist’s perspective to the study of the ocean. In many ways the ocean community is positioned to do what atmospheric scientists did in the 1950s when they established a network of weather stations. This network dramatically expanded our predictive capabilities to the benefit of any weather-sensitive business or human endeavor. Our planet is a complex dynamic system of interactions among the atmosphere, ocean, land surface, snow and ice, and all life on Earth. In that planetary clockworks, the ocean is a key cog. It drives heat, water and nutrients around the globe. It maintains essential ecosystems. In short, it makes our planet habitable. We know the ocean is changing rapidly. It is warming, becoming more acidic and losing sea ice. Sea levels are rising. It is overfished and more polluted by chemicals and noise. These changes will have impacts on agriculture, fisheries, water, food, energy supplies, coastal infrastructure, transportation, and natural disasters such as tsunamis and extreme weather — all of which profoundly affect our economy, health, welfare and security. At the same time, many nations are developing “blue economies” — expanding into the ocean not only to extract resources such as fish, minerals, and oil and gas, but also for aquaculture, bioprospecting, offshore renewable energy and other economic opportunities. In my vision of the ocean in 2050, governments are investing in research and development to establish long-term observatories with sensors to monitor ocean conditions and collect the data necessary to help us understand our changing ocean. Right now the future of the ocean is uncertain, which means our future is uncertain. With greater global investment in research, exploration and innovation, we can reduce uncertainties, improve projections about future conditions for our ocean and planet, and provide information that governments, resource managers, businesses and others can use to save lives, property and money, and to sustain the ocean as a resource. We can improve governance of the ocean and of the entire planetary commons — and help ensure our survival. </p>

            <h3> Douglas McCauley: Managing Change Ecologist and Conservation Biologist, UC Santa Barbara </h3>
            <p> The decisions we make in the next several decades will more profoundly shape the future of the ocean than any other period in human history. In a recent report, my colleagues and I showed that the oceans are in vastly better shape than terrestrial ecosystems. This makes sense: humans are a terrestrial species and historically it has been harder for us hunt, farm and build in the ocean. But things are changing. We must address three major challenges in the next 30 years if we wish to preserve the health and wildness of our global oceans. Marine Industrialization. A marine industrial revolution (alternatively called an emerging blue economy) is welling up in our oceans and represents a dramatic shift in the way we do marine business. Historically we went to sea to fish. By 2050, we are poised to see massive expansions in marine industries like seabed mining, underwater power plant construction (e.g., offshore wind, tidal energy) and oil/gas extraction. On land when we shifted from hunting animals to building our industries in their habitats, we saw a major spike in wildlife extinction. If we don’t carefully plan out marine industrialization, we may face a similar fate for ocean wildlife. Fishing vs. farming in the oceans. The Food and Agriculture Organization predicts that in less than 20 years fish farming will put more fish on our tables than wild-capture fisheries. We have to carefully ensure this explosive growth in ocean farming happens in a clean, healthy and sustainable way. In parallel to this growth in aquaculture, we must redouble our efforts to be sure that wild fisheries can continue to provide healthy free-range fish by setting aside ocean protected areas and coming up with novel solutions for managing the lawlessness associated with fishing in many settings (e.g., the high seas). Ocean climate change. None of these actions will have purchase if we don’t slow the rates by which we are warming and acidifying the oceans. Many marine species have demonstrated a very encouraging capacity for adaptation to climate stressors. Anything we can do to slow carbon emissions will buy them time to adapt. By squarely facing the urgency of the situation in the oceans and prudently managing these new forces of change, we can chart a brighter future for life in the oceans and can avoid making many of the environmental mistakes we made on land. </p>

            <h3> David Agnew: Sustainable Fishing Standards Director, Marine Stewardship Council </h3>
            <p> Oceans are like the heartbeat of our planet. They connect us across continents, regulate our climate, supply us with oxygen and serve as the foundation of ecosystems for an incredible array of wildlife. More than 200 million people depend on the oceans for their livelihood and another 3 billion rely on it for nutrition, making oceans crucial to our very existence. But our oceans are under enormous pressure. Fishing in a sustainable manner is critical to the health of this vast natural resource. It is our vision at the Marine Stewardship Council to see our oceans healthy and teeming with life, safeguarded for future generations. We need to appreciate this important global resource, work together to provide solutions to overfishing and care for the oceans as they are fundamental to the health and well-being of our world and population. We can all start by recognizing and rewarding sustainable fishing practices and choosing to buy and eat seafood sourced from sustainable and well-managed fisheries, such as seafood products with the MSC ecolabel. The more we learn about the issues facing our oceans, the more we’ll want to help ensure the health and vitality of this resource and then share that knowledge to inspire others to do the same. We are all connected, and we can each make a difference and contribute to the health of the world’s oceans for this and future generations. </p>

            <h1> The future of transportation: Where will we go? </h1>
            <p> Take a look at the future of transportation where sustainable and autonomous technology rule. Since early times, humans have sought ways to make traveling faster and more convenient. First, we invented the wheel, then carts and wagons, steam power, and the internal combustion engine. The innovation continued with electric cars, bikes and autonomous vehicles. Ideas that seemed to belong only to the realm of science fiction are being made a reality. Read on to find out what’s coming next in the exciting future of transportation. </p>

            <h3> Three concepts driving the future of transportation </h3>
            <p> The future of transportation involves moving into new, smarter sources of energy, modes of transport and physical and technological infrastructure to support these transportation innovations. Three common themes in transportation innovation are: smart technology electrification autonomy Given the rapid expansion of these technologies in recent years, we can assume all will be major contributors to our transportation future. </p>

            <h2> New transportation innovations </h2>
            <p> Will public transportation take to the skies? This could soon be a reality. Successful demonstration flights of Autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) have been carried out already. Although similar to drones, which are generally unmanned, AAVs are different. AAVs are essentially autonomous human-carrying drones, designed for transporting passengers. Most configurations of these flying vehicles use Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) through horizontal rotors, which require no runway. The idea is to put commuters into AAVs, taking them off congested roadways and to their destinations on direct routes, greatly cutting travel times. The Ehang 184 is a concept for 5G-connected urban air mobility, controlled through a smart city command center, and is set to be a world’s first Air Taxi to debut in Qatar for the FIFA World Cup in 2022. </p>

            <h3> Hoverbikes </h3>
            <p> This concept is comparable to an AAV, in that it uses a VTOL platform. However, instead of being unmanned, a human operator rides and controls the hoverbike. The form factor resembles a common motorbike with four rotors (quadcopter) capable of carrying one person. Again, the aim is to provide a method of mobility that alleviates street traffic for short distance travel. Hoversurf, a Russian company, has developed the S3 2019 Hoverbike, a battery-powered, one piece carbon fiber frame, capable of flying 96 KMph at 33 feet of altitude. At a cost of $150,000 per bike, the hoverbike won’t be an option for daily commuters any time soon. </p>

            <h3> Self-driving taxis </h3>
            <p> Autonomous cars are on the cusp of widespread deployment, although largely still constrained to testing environments and pilot projects. They are on roads today and are active in cities like Las Vegas, where Lyft offers autonomous rides for a fare, in their fleet of 30 ‘Aptiv’ vehicles. These vehicles represent more than just EV and autonomous efficiencies, but rather a Smart Mobility mentality. Using ICT these futuristic taxis communicate with each other, with smart infrastructure and IoT, with customers and gather mass amounts of data to drive further efficiencies while they move around Smart Cities. </p>

            <h3> The Hyperloop </h3>
            <p> The idea of the Hyperloop was first envisioned by Elon Musk in 2012. This future mode of transportation is designed for longer haul transportation between cities, countries or even continents. The principle of the Hyperloop is based on the movement of people in capsules or pods that travel and high speeds though tubes over long distances. Inside the tubes is a low pressure environment void of air, while the pods use magnetic levitation (MagLev) technology for propulsion. The low pressure and MagLev, create a very low friction environment allowing the pods to travel upwards of 600 MPH. Virgin Hyperloop One currently has a 500 meter test track in Apex, Nevada, called the DevLoop. Hyperloop projects are now being considered in India, the US, the UK, Canada, and Mexico. Other examples include differing version of autonomous MagLev trains suspended above city streets; cable cars far above urban skylines; hybrid cars with wings; electric bikes, skateboards and other personal mobility devices; autonomous busses; even Falcon 9 Rockets to leverage the speed of space flight to get people around the globe quickly. Many of these are far into development and even wider implementation. </p>

            <h2> The costs of transportation and motivation for change </h2>
            <p> The human population of Earth is growing and moving into urban areas exponentially. Travel on roadways designed 20, 50 or even over 100 years ago cannot sustain the demand for modern mobility needs. The result is traffic congestion on our roadways. Traffic inefficiencies cost the global economy hundreds of billions of dollars annually. Road, air, rail and marine transportation do not always operate as a seamless integrated network, contributing to further cost and delay. Coupled with the current reliance on fossil fuels, transportation is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, comprising 28.9% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2017, according to the EPA. Greenhouse gases are a cause of climate change and pose a risk to human health and safety. The World Health Organization (WHO) has found that ambient air pollution resulting from vehicles, in addition to other sources, causes millions of premature deaths and disease around the world. Geotab GmbH is collaborating with Center Smart Services on the RWTH Aachen Campus in Germany to investigate air quality in Aachen. The Mobile AirQuality Measurement project aims to gather hyper-local air quality to support the optimization of traffic planning and management. </p>

            <h2> What will happen to today’s transportation? </h2>
            <p> It is widely believed that the individual ownership of cars globally will decrease significantly over the coming decades. Currently, the U.S. has the highest concentration of cars per capita worldwide, with just over 800 cars per 1,000 people in 2014, higher than Canada, Europe and the Pacific. The European Union figure as of 2017 is 602 per 1,000 inhabitants. In Canada, a 2019 study by automotive data company Canadian Black Book reveals that 35% of Canadians aged 18-34 plan to reduce their household fleet over the next two years, and 41% of that same age group plan to do so in the next 10 years. </p>

            <h2> Get ready for the mobility revolution </h2>
            <p> New mobility services and the high cost of vehicle ownership are persuading commuters to look to alternative options. Ridesharing, though companies such as Uber, Lyft, Car2Go, Zipcar, and others is growing rapidly. In the same Canadian Black Book study, 27% of Canadians 18-34 rely on these types of mobility services already. Many auto manufacturers are racing to accommodate the coming industry revolution — integrating EVs in their lineups and investing in mobility research and development. Transportation author and speaker Lukas Neckermann states that a “mobility revolution” is coming for the automobile industry which is defined by the three zeros: zero emissions, zero accidents and zero ownership. Neckermann says, “The most powerful tool for mobility is your smartphone.” A transportation revolution has begun. Big data, IoT and zero emission technologies provide hope for cleaner and more efficient methods of transportation. Cars will still be on our roads, however the energy that powers them and the way in which they are bought, leased or rented and operated will certainly change. The above examples are just some of the innovations on the horizon for the future of human transportation. </p>

            <h1> What is the future of energy? </h1>
            <h2> Everyone knows about green energy, but what about smart energy? </h2>
            <p> The future landscape of the energy industry is set to be transformed by technological innovations that drive towards a more convenient, efficient and ecological infrastructure. Energy systems of the future will be vastly different to what we know and use today. The scale of change over the next couple of decades will be considerable. It’s common knowledge that burning fossil fuels as a way to harbour energy is both dirty and bad for the environment. Technological advancements in the energy sector will look to leave this approach in the past. </p>

            <h4> Decentralised production </h4>
            <p> As we stand, the burning of fossil fuels takes place in a small number of large-scale plants. These currently work at about 50 percent efficiency and waste a significant amount of heat. Future energy plants will be smaller in scale and far more commonplace. These producers of low-cost renewables will bring energy to a local level, allowing the everyday person to generate and trade energy. A significant benefit of bringing energy production to a local level is the reduction is waste. Surplus heat from localised producers will be passed on to nearby homes and businesses. By taking a local approach, we are also likely to see a reduction in waste as energy has less distance to cover. This shift towards a new greener way of producing and consuming energy will only be possible if major consumers are on board. For instance, the cold chain in the UK is believed to currently consume around 14 percent of all electricity, with food retailers operating large networks of machines distributed throughout the UK. </p>

            <h4> Internet of energy </h4>
            <p> The Internet of Things is an emerging tech industry which is already receiving a significant amount of press and attention. This type of technology is starting to be utilised to deliver a greener approach to energy use. The ‘internet of energy’ will make use of connected digital systems to control how we use and store energy. Modern appliances are being designed with a level of interconnectivity. This means we can programme each item to use or not use energy when we choose. An example of this will be the flexibility to allow for power surges or lulls. For instance, at half time of major football matches, there’s usually a surge of energy demand when people make drinks or food. To meet this demand, we can either utilise the power from a local power station or alternatively, power down other appliances for as little as ten minutes to satisfy the excess needs in an eco-friendly way. This goes a step further. If you have a surplus of energy (such as an electric vehicle), it will be notified of the demand and, if programmed to do so, sell some of its stored energy back to the grid to make you money.  </p>

            <h4> Energy as a service </h4>
            <p> It’s important for energy to become part of the circular economy. This is where resources are kept in use for as long as possible, recovered, regenerated and re-used wherever possible. For this to be a reality, there will need to be a shift away from buying energy in kWh and towards buying energy as a service. Buying energy as a service means that consumers won’t purchase energy from a supplier. They’ll instead pay a company for energy at the best price, get the best value from the energy they generate and will actively improve the efficiency of their homes so they use less. </p>

            <h4> Free energy </h4>
            <p> Energy doesn’t have to be a drain on the environment – or people’s wallets. It has become easier than ever for us to generate green energy. The cost of renewable equipment is falling while the amount of energy on the grid is increasing. The UK is now home to so many renewables that on particularly sunny or windy days, there’s actually a surplus of energy on the grid. This can have a negative effect on wholesale prices, meaning you could actually be paid to use or store the energy. Essentially allowing consumers to enjoy free green energy. </p>

            <h4> Focus on consumers </h4>
            <p> One of the largest changes that will take place is that consumers will find themselves at the very core of the energy industry. The control will be placed in their hands and it’s important for users to be educated on how to be as eco-friendly with this as possible. An active user of energy in the future will be able to play a vital role in ensuring our energy isn’t having a detrimental impact on the Earth. </p>

        <h1> Future Climate </h1>

        <h3> Climate Change: Variations in Timing </h3>
        <p> Across the globe, in response to increases in heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, temperature and precipitation patterns are changing. The rate of climatic change in the next century is expected to be significantly higher than it has been in the past. At our current rate of emissions, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that CO2 levels in the atmosphere will double or triple during the next century, and the climate system will respond. Scientists expect some portions of the Earth system to respond more rapidly to the changing composition of the atmosphere than others. For instance, the temperature of the atmosphere and the uppermost layer of the ocean are likely to adjust to new conditions more quickly than the deep ocean or thick ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica. As a result of the different response rates, scientists predict that regional climatic changes will vary. For example, climate models project that some areas will see more precipitation and others will have less.  </p>

        <h3> Rapid Changes </h3>
        <p> Climate scientists expect to see the following changes within decades to hundreds of years: Retreating or vanishing glacial ice Disappearance of year-round sea ice in the Arctic Replacement of polar tundra by conifer forests </p>

        <h3> Slower Changes </h3>
        <p> The following changes are likely to occur over hundreds to thousands of years: Changes in melt patterns on Greenland Ice Sheet Increased rates of flows of ice streams in Greenland and Antarctica Increase in thermal expansion of ocean Disappearance of West Antarctic Ice Sheet Ocean acidification (related to CO2 emissions rather than warming) Decreases in ocean oxygen levels </p>

        <h3> Changes to the Seasons </h3>
        <p> Though Earth will always have distinct seasons because of its tilted axis, one expected signal of climate change is a shift in the length and character of summer and winter seasons. In general, summer temperatures will arrive earlier than they currently do, especially at high latitudes. Additionally, they will be hotter and last longer than they do now. Future winters will arrive later and be shorter and warmer. Around the world, climatologists have already observed increases in the number of days of record heat, and concurrent decreases in the number of days of record cold. </p>

        <h3> Using the Past to Predict the Future </h3>
        <p> While the climate record has no perfect analog for the changes we expect to occur in the future, we can use a climatic event that happened 55 million years ago—the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM)—as an example of our potential climate future. At the time of the PETM, natural records (climate proxies) show that the abundance of CO2 in the atmosphere rose to 2000 parts per million within the span of 10,000 years. Subsequently, Earth’s average global temperature rose by approximately 11 degrees Fahrenheit (6 degrees Celsius). The result of this rapid temperature increase wiped out plants and animals that couldn’t adapt to the new conditions. Whether current plants and animals will be able to adapt to upcoming changes in climate remains an open question. Just as in past climatic shifts, some species will flourish while others will struggle, or simply vanish. Exactly how future climate will develop is an ongoing question – one that is being closely monitored by scientists and citizens around the world. </p>

        <h1> The future of food: What will you be eating in 2050? </h1>
        <p> With growing pressures from a rising world population, global warming, inequality in access to food, and changing views on sustainability, the food we eat will undergo major changes in the future. Whatever your favorite dishes may be today, chances are they will look quite different in 20 to 30 years. Overall, the culinary landscape is predicted to undergo major changes in the decades ahead – not only because our habits and attitudes towards food are changing. By 2050, the global population is expected to hit 10 billion people. This means that – to feed everyone – it will take 56 per cent more food than is produced in the world today, according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Unfortunately, there is not enough agricultural land available to provide larger future populations with the kind of diet people are eating in most countries today. This suggests that the crops we cultivate, and the food we eat today, will undergo significant changes. </p>

        <h2> Why we will need to eat differently </h2>
        <p> The key reasons which are necessitating a fundamental shift in how we think about food can be summarised as: population growth effects of global warming inequality in access to food Even though global poverty has seen a sharp decline over the past decades, there are still far too many people living hungry in the world. To make matters worse, global warming is "very likely to affect global, regional, and local food security by disrupting food availability, decreasing access to food, and making utilisation more difficult", predicts the U.S. Department of Agriculture. All of these factors mean that in the years to come, mankind will be looking at alternate crops that can be grown with a smaller carbon footprint, in sufficient quantities, and which will have high nutritional value. From lab-grown meat, edible insects, seaweed, a stronger shift towards plant-based foods, to massive changes in food production and agriculture, the next decades will see a considerable shift in what food we put on our plates. </p>
        
        <h3> Eating differently </h3>
        <p> In a future that will require tackling multiple challenges at once, consumers will not be left without options. After all, eating fulfills emotional and social needs in addition to providing nourishment. Food culture is an integral part of most societies, and most people will probably not want to change it. So here is what's in store for food menus: </p>
        
        <h2> Edible Insects </h2>
        <p> Close to 2 billion people on earth already practice entomophagy, or the eating of insects. Edible insects have been consumed by various cultures for centuries and may be integral to the future of food security. Not only are insects rich sources of protein and other essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and amino acids, they are also more eco-friendly to grow, causing far less harm to the planet than the consumption of meat. Different startups and large companies have already jumped on the bandwagon. Aspire Food Group is currently building "the world’s largest ever cricket farm, powered by IoT", and the company already operates scalable, flexible cricket farms in the U.S. </p>

        <h2> Seaweeds </h2>
        <p> Seaweeds/algae (sometimes referred to as sea vegetables) are another food trend that has already made inroads into our dietary habits. You may have already consumed them in sushi or in the form of spirulina, a popular addition to the diets of the super health-conscious. Like insects, seaweeds also cause little harm to the environment, grow quickly, and contain many nutrients, making them an ideal candidate as a food of the future. Canadian startup Cascadia Seaweed, for example, already operates offshore farms and a seed nursery, and it is now focused on launching consumer food products. </p>

        <h2> Plant-based meat </h2>
        <p> A lot of research is going into the area of crafting plant-based meats. A molecule called heme that can carry the taste and texture of meat is being adapted for uses in new food products. Other ingredients like wheat-based protein, coconut oil, and potato starch are also in play in the creation of plant-based alternatives to meat. The market is expanding rapidly, with one of the most successful IPOs in the last few years belonging to Beyond Meat, a company specialised in plant-based meat substitutes. </p>

        <h2> Lab-grown meat </h2>
        <p> For those who still cannot get around the fact that plant-based meat is, well, not meat, there are lab-grown alternatives that are, in fact, real meat – except that no animals need to be killed or harmed in making it. The first burger made of lab-grown meat cost a whopping $325,000 to make back in 2013. However, dozens of startups and companies are currently involved in developing lab-grown meat. With a taste and texture that is incredibly close to actual meat, lab-grown meat is well on its way to making the concept of growing animals for slaughter an anachronism. A few years ago, the cost of a lab-grown burger dropped to just $12. Given the speed of development, the "lab-grown protein market may account for 35 per cent of the global meat market by 2040", estimates AT Kearny. </p>

        <p> So, does the future of food look high-tech and flavorless? Not necessarily, as it is set to be healthier, sometimes tastier, and probably more sustainable. Overall, these alternatives are predicted to be better for the planet and for biodiversity. Food will certainly be produced and consumed quite differently in the coming decades. </p>
